    "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having\n",
    "little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me\n",
    "on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part\n",
    "of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and\n",
    "regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about\n",
    "the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever\n",
    "I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and\n",
    "bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever\n",
    "my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral\n",
    "principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and\n",
    "methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to\n",
    "get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.\n",
    "With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I\n",
    "quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they\n",
    "but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,\n",
    "cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\n",
    "wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her\n",
    "surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme\n",
    "downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and\n",
    "cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of\n",
    "land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears\n",
    "Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What\n",
    "do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand\n",
    "thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some\n",
    "leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some\n",
    "looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the\n",
    "rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these\n",
    "are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to\n",
    "counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are\n",
    "the green fields gone? What do they here?\n",
    "\n",
    "But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and\n",
    "seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the\n",
    "extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder\n",
    "warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water\n",
    "as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of\n",
    "them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets\n",
    "and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell\n",
    "me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all\n",
    "those ships attract them thither?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take\n",
    "almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a\n",
    "dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in\n",
    "it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest\n",
    "reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will\n",
    "infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.\n",
    "Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this\n",
    "experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical\n",
    "professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for\n",
    "ever.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\n",
    "quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley\n",
    "of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his\n",
    "trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were\n",
    "within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up\n",
    "from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands\n",
    "winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in\n",
    "their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and\n",
    "though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this\n",
    "shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were\n",
    "fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,\n",
    "when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among\n",
    "Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop\n",
    "of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel\n",
    "your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon\n",
    "suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy\n",
    "him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian\n",
    "trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a\n",
    "robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?\n",
    "Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a\n",
    "mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out\n",
    "of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did\n",
    "the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely\n",
    "all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that\n",
    "story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild\n",
    "image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that\n",
    "same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image\n",
    "of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin\n",
    "to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my\n",
    "lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a\n",
    "passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a\n",
    "purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers\n",
    "get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy\n",
    "themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger;\n",
    "nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a\n",
    "Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction\n",
    "of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all\n",
    "honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind\n",
    "whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,\n",
    "without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.\n",
    "And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory\n",
    "in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I\n",
    "never fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously\n",
    "buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who\n",
    "will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled\n",
    "fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old\n",
    "Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the\n",
    "mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\n",
    "plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\n",
    "True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\n",
    "spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of\n",
    "thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor,\n",
    "particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the\n",
    "Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if\n",
    "just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been\n",
    "lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in\n",
    "awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a\n",
    "schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and\n",
    "the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off\n",
    "in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom\n",
    "and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,\n",
    "I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel\n",
    "Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and\n",
    "respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t\n",
    "a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may\n",
    "order me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the\n",
    "satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is\n",
    "one way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or\n",
    "metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is\n",
    "passed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades,\n",
    "and be content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\n",
    "paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\n",
    "penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must\n",
    "pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and\n",
    "being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable\n",
    "infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being\n",
    "paid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man\n",
    "receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly\n",
    "believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no\n",
    "account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign\n",
    "ourselves to perdition!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\n",
    "exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,\n",
    "head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\n",
    "you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\n",
    "Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\n",
    "the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not\n",
    "so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many\n",
    "other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But\n",
    "wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a\n",
    "merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling\n",
    "voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the\n",
    "constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in\n",
    "some unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And,\n",
    "doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand\n",
    "programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in\n",
    "as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive\n",
    "performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run\n",
    "something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "“_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._\n",
    "“WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the\n",
    "Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when\n",
    "others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short\n",
    "and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I\n",
    "cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the\n",
    "circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives\n",
    "which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced\n",
    "me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the\n",
    "delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill\n",
    "and discriminating judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale\n",
    "himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my\n",
    "curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island\n",
    "bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all\n",
    "the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,\n",
    "helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things\n",
    "would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an\n",
    "everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and\n",
    "land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to\n",
    "perceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let\n",
    "me—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of\n",
    "the place one lodges in.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the\n",
    "great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild\n",
    "conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into\n",
    "my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them\n",
    "all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my\n",
    "arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city\n",
    "of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night\n",
    "in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little\n",
    "packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching\n",
    "that place would offer, till the following Monday.\n",
    "\n",
    "As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at\n",
    "this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well\n",
    "be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was\n",
    "made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a\n",
    "fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous\n",
    "old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has\n",
    "of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though\n",
    "in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket\n",
    "was her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the\n",
    "first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket\n",
    "did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes\n",
    "to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did\n",
    "that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with\n",
    "imported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in\n",
    "order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\n",
    "bowsprit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me\n",
    "in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a\n",
    "matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a\n",
    "very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold\n",
    "and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had\n",
    "sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,\n",
    "wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of\n",
    "a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the\n",
    "north with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you\n",
    "may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to\n",
    "inquire the price, and don’t be too particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The\n",
    "Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further\n",
    "on, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came\n",
    "such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and\n",
    "ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay\n",
    "ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,\n",
    "when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from\n",
    "hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most\n",
    "miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one\n",
    "moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of\n",
    "the tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t\n",
    "you hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are\n",
    "stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets\n",
    "that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not\n",
    "the cheeriest inns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,\n",
    "and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At\n",
    "this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of\n",
    "the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light\n",
    "proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood\n",
    "invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the\n",
    "uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble\n",
    "over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying\n",
    "particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,\n",
    "Gomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then\n",
    "must needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and\n",
    "hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior\n",
    "door.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black\n",
    "faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of\n",
    "Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the\n",
    "preacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping\n",
    "and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing\n",
    "out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the\n",
    "docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a\n",
    "swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly\n",
    "representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words\n",
    "underneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought\n",
    "I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this\n",
    "Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and\n",
    "the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated\n",
    "little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here\n",
    "from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a\n",
    "poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very\n",
    "spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied\n",
    "as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,\n",
    "where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than\n",
    "ever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,\n",
    "is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the\n",
    "hob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind\n",
    "called Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the\n",
    "only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou\n",
    "lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the\n",
    "outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where\n",
    "the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only\n",
    "glazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my\n",
    "mind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are\n",
    "windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t\n",
    "stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint\n",
    "here and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The\n",
    "universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted\n",
    "off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth\n",
    "against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with\n",
    "his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a\n",
    "corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the\n",
    "tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken\n",
    "wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty\n",
    "night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their\n",
    "oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\n",
    "privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up\n",
    "to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra\n",
    "than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the\n",
    "line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in\n",
    "order to keep out this frost?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the\n",
    "door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be\n",
    "moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a\n",
    "Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a\n",
    "temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.\n",
    "\n",
    "But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there\n",
    "is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted\n",
    "feet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\n",
    "low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\n",
    "the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large\n",
    "oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the\n",
    "unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent\n",
    "study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of\n",
    "the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\n",
    "purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first\n",
    "you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New\n",
    "England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint\n",
    "of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\n",
    "especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the\n",
    "entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however\n",
    "wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,\n",
    "portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\n",
    "picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\n",
    "nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive\n",
    "a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\n",
    "half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to\n",
    "it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what\n",
    "that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,\n",
    "deceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight\n",
    "gale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.—It’s a\n",
    "blasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of\n",
    "the icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to\n",
    "that one portentous something in the picture’s midst. _That_ once found\n",
    "out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint\n",
    "resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\n",
    "partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\n",
    "whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner\n",
    "in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its\n",
    "three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,\n",
    "purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of\n",
    "impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\n",
    "array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with\n",
    "glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots\n",
    "of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\n",
    "round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\n",
    "mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal\n",
    "and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,\n",
    "horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances\n",
    "and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With\n",
    "this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan\n",
    "Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that\n",
    "harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas, and run away\n",
    "with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The\n",
    "original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle\n",
    "sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last\n",
    "was found imbedded in the hump.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut\n",
    "through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\n",
    "fireplaces all round—you enter the public room. A still duskier place\n",
    "is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled\n",
    "planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s\n",
    "cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored\n",
    "old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like\n",
    "table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities\n",
    "gathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting from the\n",
    "further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude\n",
    "attempt at a right whale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the\n",
    "vast arched bone of the whale’s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost\n",
    "drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old\n",
    "decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,\n",
    "like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),\n",
    "bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells\n",
    "the sailors deliriums and death.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true\n",
    "cylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses\n",
    "deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians\n",
    "rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to\n",
    "_this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to _this_ a penny more;\n",
    "and so on to the full glass—the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp\n",
    "down for a shilling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about\n",
    "a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I\n",
    "sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with\n",
    "a room, received for answer that his house was full—not a bed\n",
    "unoccupied. “But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haint no\n",
    "objections to sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are\n",
    "goin’ a-whalin’, so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.”\n",
    "\n",
    "I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\n",
    "ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that\n",
    "if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\n",
    "harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\n",
    "further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with\n",
    "the half of any decent man’s blanket.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper?\n",
    "Supper’ll be ready directly.”\n",
    "\n",
    "I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\n",
    "Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with\n",
    "his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\n",
    "between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but\n",
    "he didn’t make much headway, I thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\n",
    "adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said\n",
    "he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a\n",
    "winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold\n",
    "to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the\n",
    "fare was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but\n",
    "dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a\n",
    "green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\n",
    "manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "“My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead\n",
    "sartainty.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, “the\n",
    "harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he\n",
    "don’t—he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes ’em rare.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark\n",
    "complexioned” harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so\n",
    "turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into\n",
    "bed before I did.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not\n",
    "what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the\n",
    "evening as a looker on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord\n",
    "cried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing\n",
    "this morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now\n",
    "we’ll have the latest news from the Feegees.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\n",
    "open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their\n",
    "shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,\n",
    "all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they\n",
    "seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from\n",
    "their boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then,\n",
    "that they made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the\n",
    "wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out\n",
    "brimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon\n",
    "which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he\n",
    "swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never\n",
    "mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,\n",
    "or on the weather side of an ice-island.\n",
    "\n",
    "The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\n",
    "with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began\n",
    "capering about most obstreperously.\n",
    "\n",
    "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\n",
    "he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\n",
    "own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\n",
    "noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the\n",
    "sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\n",
    "but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I\n",
    "will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six\n",
    "feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I\n",
    "have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and\n",
    "burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the\n",
    "deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem\n",
    "to give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a\n",
    "Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of\n",
    "those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When\n",
    "the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man\n",
    "slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my\n",
    "comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his\n",
    "shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with\n",
    "them, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s\n",
    "Bulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost\n",
    "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself\n",
    "upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the\n",
    "entrance of the seamen.\n",
    "\n",
    "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\n",
    "rather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but\n",
    "people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\n",
    "sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,\n",
    "and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\n",
    "multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\n",
    "sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\n",
    "two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all\n",
    "sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\n",
    "cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\n",
    "thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\n",
    "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\n",
    "the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\n",
    "Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home\n",
    "and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\n",
    "midnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\n",
    "\n",
    "“Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t sleep\n",
    "with him. I’ll try the bench here.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a\n",
    "mattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and\n",
    "notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane\n",
    "there in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying\n",
    "he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\n",
    "the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning\n",
    "like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\n",
    "plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\n",
    "near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the\n",
    "bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\n",
    "in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\n",
    "shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in\n",
    "the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a\n",
    "brown study.\n",
    "\n",
    "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\n",
    "short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\n",
    "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\n",
    "than the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the\n",
    "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\n",
    "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\n",
    "soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from\n",
    "under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,\n",
    "especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from\n",
    "the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\n",
    "the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\n",
    "night.\n",
    "\n",
    "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal\n",
    "a march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\n",
    "wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\n",
    "second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\n",
    "morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\n",
    "standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\n",
    "spending a sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began\n",
    "to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\n",
    "against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be\n",
    "dropping in before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps\n",
    "we may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.\n",
    "\n",
    "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,\n",
    "and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such\n",
    "late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\n",
    "mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he\n",
    "answered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to\n",
    "rise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out\n",
    "a peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late,\n",
    "unless, may be, he can’t sell his head.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are\n",
    "telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,\n",
    "landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\n",
    "Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around\n",
    "this town?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t\n",
    "sell it here, the market’s overstocked.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“With what?” shouted I.\n",
    "\n",
    "“With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better\n",
    "stop spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I\n",
    "rayther guess you’ll be done _brown_ if that ere harpooneer hears you a\n",
    "slanderin’ his head.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at\n",
    "this unaccountable farrago of the landlord’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s broke a’ready,” said he.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Broke,” said I—“_broke_, do you mean?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\n",
    "snow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\n",
    "another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a\n",
    "bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\n",
    "belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have\n",
    "not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\n",
    "exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\n",
    "towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion,\n",
    "landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\n",
    "degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\n",
    "harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the\n",
    "night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay\n",
    "that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good\n",
    "evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I’ve no idea of\n",
    "sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, _you_ I mean, landlord, _you_,\n",
    "sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render\n",
    "yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long\n",
    "sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be\n",
    "easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived\n",
    "from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand\n",
    "heads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and\n",
    "that one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it\n",
    "would not do to be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is\n",
    "goin’ to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as\n",
    "he was goin’ out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for\n",
    "all the airth like a string of inions.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\n",
    "that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the\n",
    "same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\n",
    "Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal\n",
    "business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\n",
    "\n",
    "“Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful\n",
    "late, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me\n",
    "slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room\n",
    "for two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,\n",
    "afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the\n",
    "foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and\n",
    "somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.\n",
    "Arter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a\n",
    "glim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards\n",
    "me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\n",
    "clock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that\n",
    "harpooneer to-night; he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then;\n",
    "_do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was\n",
    "ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,\n",
    "with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\n",
    "harpooneers to sleep abreast.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest\n",
    "that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make\n",
    "yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from\n",
    "eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of\n",
    "the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then\n",
    "glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\n",
    "could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,\n",
    "the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a\n",
    "whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a\n",
    "hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a\n",
    "large seaman’s bag, containing the harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in\n",
    "lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone\n",
    "fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon\n",
    "standing at the head of the bed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\n",
    "light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\n",
    "arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it\n",
    "to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little\n",
    "tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\n",
    "Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as\n",
    "you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible\n",
    "that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the\n",
    "streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to\n",
    "try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy\n",
    "and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious\n",
    "harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit\n",
    "of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my\n",
    "life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink\n",
    "in the neck.\n",
    "\n",
    "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\n",
    "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on\n",
    "the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\n",
    "the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a\n",
    "little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,\n",
    "half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about\n",
    "the harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very\n",
    "late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,\n",
    "and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself\n",
    "to the care of heaven.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\n",
    "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\n",
    "sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\n",
    "pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard\n",
    "a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into\n",
    "the room from under the door.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\n",
    "head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\n",
    "till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\n",
    "Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\n",
    "looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on\n",
    "the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted\n",
    "cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was\n",
    "all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time\n",
    "while employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however,\n",
    "he turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was\n",
    "of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with\n",
    "large blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a\n",
    "terrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here\n",
    "he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his\n",
    "face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\n",
    "sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were\n",
    "stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;\n",
    "but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story\n",
    "of a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had\n",
    "been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course\n",
    "of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And\n",
    "what is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be\n",
    "honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\n",
    "complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely\n",
    "independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\n",
    "nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot\n",
    "sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\n",
    "never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\n",
    "extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\n",
    "passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\n",
    "all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\n",
    "fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\n",
    "seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in\n",
    "the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly\n",
    "thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\n",
    "hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.\n",
    "There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a\n",
    "small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now\n",
    "looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\n",
    "stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\n",
    "than ever I bolted a dinner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but\n",
    "it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this\n",
    "head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\n",
    "Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\n",
    "confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of\n",
    "him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\n",
    "the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game\n",
    "enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\n",
    "concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed\n",
    "his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were\n",
    "checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all\n",
    "over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’\n",
    "War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still\n",
    "more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs\n",
    "were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that\n",
    "he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman\n",
    "in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to\n",
    "think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own\n",
    "brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!\n",
    "\n",
    "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\n",
    "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\n",
    "that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,\n",
    "or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in\n",
    "the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image\n",
    "with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old\n",
    "Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought\n",
    "that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar\n",
    "manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened\n",
    "a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing\n",
    "but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage\n",
    "goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,\n",
    "sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the\n",
    "andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,\n",
    "so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine\n",
    "or chapel for his Congo idol.\n",
    "\n",
    "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\n",
    "ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes\n",
    "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\n",
    "them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\n",
    "top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\n",
    "a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the\n",
    "fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed\n",
    "to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the\n",
    "biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite\n",
    "offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to\n",
    "fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these\n",
    "strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from\n",
    "the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing\n",
    "some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in\n",
    "the most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the\n",
    "idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket\n",
    "as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing\n",
    "him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\n",
    "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\n",
    "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\n",
    "I had so long been bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\n",
    "Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for\n",
    "an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the\n",
    "handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment\n",
    "the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between\n",
    "his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it\n",
    "now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\n",
    "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\n",
    "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his\n",
    "guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my\n",
    "meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.”\n",
    "And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the\n",
    "dark.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch!\n",
    "Coffin! Angels! save me!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the\n",
    "cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the\n",
    "hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.\n",
    "But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light\n",
    "in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t\n",
    "harm a hair of your head.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that that\n",
    "infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads\n",
    "around town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look\n",
    "here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\n",
    "sitting up in bed.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\n",
    "throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a\n",
    "civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a\n",
    "moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\n",
    "looking cannibal. What’s all this fuss I have been making about,\n",
    "thought I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has just\n",
    "as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep\n",
    "with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or\n",
    "whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will\n",
    "turn in with him. But I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with\n",
    "me. It’s dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\n",
    "motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to\n",
    "say—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”\n",
    "\n",
    "I turned in, and never slept better in my life.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown\n",
    "over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\n",
    "thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\n",
    "odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\n",
    "tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no\n",
    "two parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his\n",
    "keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\n",
    "sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I\n",
    "say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork\n",
    "quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I\n",
    "could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues\n",
    "together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I\n",
    "could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\n",
    "\n",
    "My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\n",
    "child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\n",
    "whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\n",
    "circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other—I\n",
    "think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\n",
    "sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\n",
    "was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my\n",
    "mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\n",
    "bed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\n",
    "the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\n",
    "there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\n",
    "third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\n",
    "and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\n",
    "before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small\n",
    "of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun\n",
    "shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\n",
    "streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\n",
    "and worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\n",
    "stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at\n",
    "her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\n",
    "slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to\n",
    "lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and\n",
    "most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\n",
    "several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than\n",
    "I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.\n",
    "At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and\n",
    "slowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the\n",
    "before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt\n",
    "a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and\n",
    "nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.\n",
    "My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,\n",
    "silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely\n",
    "seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,\n",
    "frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet\n",
    "ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid\n",
    "spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided\n",
    "away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it\n",
    "all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in\n",
    "confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I\n",
    "often puzzle myself with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\n",
    "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\n",
    "those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm\n",
    "thrown round me. But at length all the past night’s events soberly\n",
    "recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\n",
    "the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his\n",
    "bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\n",
    "as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\n",
    "him—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my\n",
    "neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\n",
    "slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\n",
    "sleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\n",
    "pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\n",
    "broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of\n",
    "goodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\n",
    "loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\n",
    "hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\n",
    "extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\n",
    "all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in\n",
    "bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if\n",
    "he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\n",
    "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\n",
    "him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\n",
    "now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\n",
    "last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\n",
    "and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\n",
    "the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\n",
    "if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\n",
    "afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\n",
    "under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\n",
    "truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you\n",
    "will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\n",
    "particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\n",
    "civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\n",
    "staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\n",
    "the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\n",
    "a man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well\n",
    "worth unusual regarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\n",
    "one, by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his\n",
    "boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\n",
    "next movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the\n",
    "bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\n",
    "was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I\n",
    "ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\n",
    "boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\n",
    "stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\n",
    "to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\n",
    "education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\n",
    "been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\n",
    "himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\n",
    "he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\n",
    "last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\n",
    "his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\n",
    "being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\n",
    "ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him\n",
    "at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\n",
    "street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\n",
    "into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\n",
    "Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;\n",
    "I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and\n",
    "particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He\n",
    "complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\n",
    "morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\n",
    "amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\n",
    "chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\n",
    "piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water\n",
    "and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept\n",
    "his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed\n",
    "corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it\n",
    "a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the\n",
    "wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.\n",
    "Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers’s best cutlery with a\n",
    "vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came\n",
    "to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how\n",
    "exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of\n",

    "CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.\n",
    "\n",
    "I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the\n",
    "grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,\n",
    "though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my\n",
    "bedfellow.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a\n",
    "good thing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper\n",
    "person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be\n",
    "backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in\n",
    "that way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about\n",
    "him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the\n",
    "night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were\n",
    "nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates,\n",
    "and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and\n",
    "harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky\n",
    "beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning\n",
    "gowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This\n",
    "young fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and\n",
    "would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days\n",
    "landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades\n",
    "lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the\n",
    "complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly\n",
    "bleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who\n",
    "could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints,\n",
    "seemed like the Andes’ western slope, to show forth in one array,\n",
    "contrasting climates, zone by zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we\n",
    "went to breakfast.\n",
    "\n",
    "They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease\n",
    "in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though:\n",
    "Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch\n",
    "one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But\n",
    "perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as\n",
    "Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in\n",
    "the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo’s\n",
    "performances—this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode\n",
    "of attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort\n",
    "of thing is to be had anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that\n",
    "after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some\n",
    "good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man\n",
    "maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked\n",
    "embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the\n",
    "slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire\n",
    "strangers to them—and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here\n",
    "they sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same calling, all of\n",
    "kindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they\n",
    "had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green\n",
    "Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior\n",
    "whalemen!\n",
    "\n",
    "But as for Queequeg—why, Queequeg sat there among them—at the head of\n",
    "the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I\n",
    "cannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have\n",
    "cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him,\n",
    "and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it,\n",
    "to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks\n",
    "towards him. But _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him, and\n",
    "every one knows that in most people’s estimation, to do anything coolly\n",
    "is to do it genteelly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not speak of all Queequeg’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed\n",
    "coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to\n",
    "beefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew\n",
    "like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was\n",
    "sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat\n",
    "on, when I sallied out for a stroll.\n",
    "\n",

    "CHAPTER 6. The Street.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish\n",
    "an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a\n",
    "civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first\n",
    "daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.\n",
    "\n",
    "In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will\n",
    "frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign\n",
    "parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners\n",
    "will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not\n",
    "unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live\n",
    "Yankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water\n",
    "Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only\n",
    "sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street\n",
    "corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy\n",
    "flesh. It makes a stranger stare.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,\n",
    "and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft\n",
    "which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still\n",
    "more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town\n",
    "scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain\n",
    "and glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;\n",
    "fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and\n",
    "snatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence\n",
    "they came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old.\n",
    "Look there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat\n",
    "and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.\n",
    "Here comes another with a sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak.\n",
    "\n",
    "No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I mean a\n",
    "downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his\n",
    "two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a\n",
    "country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished\n",
    "reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the\n",
    "comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his\n",
    "sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his\n",
    "canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those\n",
    "straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,\n",
    "buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.\n",
    "\n",
    "But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,\n",
    "and bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a\n",
    "queer place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would\n",
    "this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of\n",
    "Labrador. As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten\n",
    "one, they look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to\n",
    "live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not\n",
    "like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run\n",
    "with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.\n",
    "Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more\n",
    "patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New\n",
    "Bedford. Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of\n",
    "a country?\n",
    "\n",
    "Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty\n",
    "mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave\n",
    "houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian\n",
    "oceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the\n",
    "bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their\n",
    "daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.\n",
    "You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,\n",
    "they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly\n",
    "burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long\n",
    "avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful\n",
    "and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by\n",
    "their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is\n",
    "art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright\n",
    "terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at\n",
    "creation’s final day.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But\n",
    "roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks\n",
    "is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that\n",
    "bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young\n",
    "girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off\n",
    "shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of\n",
    "the Puritanic sands.\n",

    "CHAPTER 7. The Chapel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman’s Chapel, and few are\n",
    "the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who\n",
    "fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this\n",
    "special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving\n",
    "sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called\n",
    "bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found\n",
    "a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors’ wives and\n",
    "widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks\n",
    "of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart\n",
    "from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and\n",
    "incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these\n",
    "silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble\n",
    "tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the\n",
    "pulpit. Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not\n",
    "pretend to quote:—\n",
    "\n",
    "SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was\n",
    "lost overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, _November_\n",
    "1_st_, 1836. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.\n",
    "\n",
    "SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,\n",
    "WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats’\n",

    "Off-shore Ground in the PACIFIC, _December_ 31_st_, 1839. THIS MARBLE\n",
    "Is here placed by their surviving SHIPMATES.\n",
    "\n",
    "SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows\n",
    "of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, _August_\n",
    "3_d_, 1833. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated\n",
    "myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see\n",
    "Queequeg near me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a\n",
    "wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage\n",
    "was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because\n",
    "he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading\n",
    "those frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of\n",
    "the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation,\n",
    "I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery,\n",
    "and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not\n",
    "the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here\n",
    "before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of\n",
    "those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed\n",
    "afresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing\n",
    "among flowers can say—here, _here_ lies my beloved; ye know not the\n",
    "desolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in\n",
    "those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in\n",
    "those immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden\n",
    "infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse\n",
    "resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a\n",
    "grave. As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as\n",
    "here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;\n",
    "why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no\n",
    "tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is\n",
    "that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix\n",
    "so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if\n",
    "he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the\n",
    "Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what\n",
    "eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies\n",
    "antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we\n",
    "still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are\n",
    "dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all\n",
    "the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify\n",
    "a whole city. All these things are not without their meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these\n",
    "dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.\n",
    "\n",
    "It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a\n",
    "Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky\n",
    "light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who\n",
    "had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But\n",
    "somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine\n",
    "chance for promotion, it seems—aye, a stove boat will make me an\n",
    "immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling—a\n",
    "speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what\n",
    "then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.\n",
    "Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true\n",
    "substance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too\n",
    "much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking\n",
    "that thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees\n",
    "of my better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is\n",
    "not me. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat\n",
    "and stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.\n",

    "CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\n",
    "robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon\n",
    "admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,\n",
    "sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it\n",
    "was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he\n",
    "was a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in\n",
    "his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the\n",
    "ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy\n",
    "winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging\n",
    "into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his\n",
    "wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing\n",
    "bloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February’s snow. No\n",
    "one having previously heard his history, could for the first time\n",
    "behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were\n",
    "certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that\n",
    "adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that\n",
    "he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for\n",
    "his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot\n",
    "cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of\n",
    "the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one\n",
    "by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;\n",
    "when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\n",
    "regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\n",
    "floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\n",
    "architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\n",
    "finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side\n",
    "ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife\n",
    "of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of\n",
    "red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely\n",
    "headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,\n",
    "considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad\n",
    "taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both\n",
    "hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple\n",
    "cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still\n",
    "reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if\n",
    "ascending the main-top of his vessel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\n",
    "with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of\n",
    "wood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of\n",
    "the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,\n",
    "these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not\n",
    "prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn\n",
    "round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder\n",
    "step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him\n",
    "impregnable in his little Quebec.\n",
    "\n",
    "I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\n",
    "Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\n",
    "sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\n",
    "mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober\n",
    "reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.\n",
    "Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies\n",
    "his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties\n",
    "and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the\n",
    "word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a\n",
    "self-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial\n",
    "well of water within the walls.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\n",
    "borrowed from the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble\n",
    "cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back\n",
    "was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating\n",
    "against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy\n",
    "breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there\n",
    "floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s\n",
    "face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\n",
    "ship’s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into\n",
    "the Victory’s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel\n",
    "seemed to say, “beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy\n",
    "helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling\n",
    "off—serenest azure is at hand.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\n",
    "had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the\n",
    "likeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\n",
    "projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship’s fiddle-headed\n",
    "beak.\n",
    "\n",
    "What could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this earth’s\n",
    "foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the\n",
    "world. From thence it is the storm of God’s quick wrath is first\n",
    "descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is\n",
    "the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.\n",
    "Yes, the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;\n",
    "and the pulpit is its prow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 9. The Sermon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered\n",
    "the scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway, there! side away\n",
    "to larboard—larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!”\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a\n",
    "still slighter shuffling of women’s shoes, and all was quiet again, and\n",
    "every eye on the preacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows, folded his\n",
    "large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and\n",
    "offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying\n",
    "at the bottom of the sea.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a\n",
    "bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he\n",
    "commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards\n",
    "the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy—\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  “The ribs and terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom,\n",
    "  While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down\n",
    "  to doom.\n",

    "of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what\n",
    "depths of the soul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant\n",
    "lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in\n",
    "the fish’s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the\n",
    "floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the\n",
    "waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But _what_\n",
    "is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a\n",
    "two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to\n",
    "me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us\n",
    "all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly\n",
    "awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally\n",
    "the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the\n",
    "sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the\n",
    "command of God—never mind now what that command was, or how\n",
    "conveyed—which he found a hard command. But all the things that God\n",
    "would have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he\n",

    "God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men\n",
    "will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the\n",
    "Captains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks\n",
    "a ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto\n",
    "unheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no\n",
    "other city than the modern Cadiz. That’s the opinion of learned men.\n",
    "And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from\n",
    "Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when\n",
    "the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern\n",
    "Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,\n",
    "the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the\n",
    "westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not\n",
    "then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?\n",
    "Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with\n",
    "slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the\n",
    "shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So\n",
    "disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen\n",
    "in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had\n",
    "been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no\n",
    "baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany him\n",
    "to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he\n",
    "finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as\n",
    "he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for\n",
    "the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s\n",
    "evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and\n",
    "confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the\n",
    "man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but\n",
    "still serious way, one whispers to the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a\n",
    "widow;” or, “Joe, do you mark him; he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I\n",
    "guess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike,\n",
    "one of the missing murderers from Sodom.” Another runs to read the bill\n",
    "that’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is\n",
    "moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a\n",
    "parricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and\n",
    "looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now\n",
    "crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah\n",
    "trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so\n",
    "much the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that\n",
    "itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the\n",
    "sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him\n",
    "pass, and he descends into the cabin.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Who’s there?’ cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making\n",
    "out his papers for the Customs—‘Who’s there?’ Oh! how that harmless\n",
    "question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again.\n",
    "But he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon\n",
    "sail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,\n",
    "though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that\n",
    "hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We sail with the\n",
    "next coming tide,’ at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing\n",
    "him. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon enough for any honest man that goes a\n",
    "passenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away\n",
    "the Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage\n",
    "money how much is that?—I’ll pay now.’ For it is particularly written,\n",
    "shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,\n",
    "‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere the craft did sail. And taken with\n",
    "the context, this is full of meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects\n",
    "crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In\n",
    "this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and\n",
    "without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\n",
    "frontiers. So Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah’s\n",
    "purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;\n",
    "and it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\n",
    "but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with\n",
    "gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions\n",
    "still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.\n",
    "Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his\n",
    "passage. ‘Point out my state-room, Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m\n",
    "travel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou lookest like it,’ says the Captain,\n",
    "‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock\n",
    "contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain\n",
    "laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of\n",
    "convicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed\n",
    "and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the\n",
    "little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is\n",
    "close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,\n",
    "beneath the ship’s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment\n",
    "of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of\n",
    "his bowels’ wards.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\n",
    "oscillates in Jonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the\n",
    "wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and\n",
    "all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity\n",
    "with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight\n",
    "itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it\n",
    "hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his\n",
    "tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful\n",
    "fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that\n",
    "contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the\n",
    "ceiling, and the side, are all awry. ‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in\n",
    "me!’ he groans, ‘straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my\n",
    "soul are all in crookedness!’\n",
    "\n",
    "“Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\n",
    "reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the\n",
    "Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him;\n",
    "as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy\n",
    "anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at\n",
    "last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as\n",
    "over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and\n",
    "there’s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,\n",
    "Jonah’s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "“And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and\n",
    "from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,\n",
    "glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded\n",
    "smugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not\n",
    "bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to\n",
    "break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when\n",
    "boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is\n",
    "shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with\n",
    "trampling feet right over Jonah’s head; in all this raging tumult,\n",
    "Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,\n",
    "feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far\n",
    "rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving\n",
    "the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides\n",
    "of the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast\n",
    "asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead\n",
    "ear, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!’ Startled from his lethargy\n",
    "by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the\n",
    "deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he\n",
    "is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave\n",
    "after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs\n",
    "roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet\n",
    "afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the\n",
    "steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing\n",
    "bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the\n",
    "tormented deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his\n",
    "cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The\n",
    "sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,\n",
    "and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to\n",
    "high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this\n",
    "great tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah’s; that discovered, then\n",
    "how furiously they mob him with their questions. ‘What is thine\n",
    "occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now,\n",
    "my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask\n",
    "him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer\n",
    "to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put\n",
    "by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard\n",
    "hand of God that is upon him.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God of Heaven\n",
    "who hath made the sea and the dry land!’ Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well\n",
    "mightest thou fear the Lord God _then!_ Straightway, he now goes on to\n",
    "make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more\n",
    "appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating\n",
    "God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his\n",
    "deserts,—when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him\n",
    "forth into the sea, for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest\n",
    "was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means\n",
    "to save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;\n",
    "then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not\n",
    "unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.\n",
    "\n",
    "“And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;\n",
    "when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea\n",
    "is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water\n",
    "behind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless\n",
    "commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into\n",
    "the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory\n",
    "teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed\n",
    "unto the Lord out of the fish’s belly. But observe his prayer, and\n",
    "learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and\n",
    "wail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is\n",
    "just. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with\n",
    "this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards\n",
    "His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance;\n",
    "not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing\n",
    "to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance\n",
    "of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah\n",
    "before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a\n",
    "model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it\n",
    "like Jonah.”\n",
    "\n",
    "While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,\n",
    "slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,\n",
    "when describing Jonah’s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.\n",
    "His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed\n",
    "the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from\n",
    "off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his\n",
    "simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the\n",
    "leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with\n",
    "closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,\n",
    "with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these\n",
    "words:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press\n",
    "upon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that\n",
    "Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to\n",
    "me, for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come\n",
    "down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit,\n",
    "and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads _me_ that other\n",
    "and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to _me_, as a pilot of the\n",
    "living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true\n",
    "things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the\n",
    "ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should\n",
    "raise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God\n",
    "by taking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never\n",
    "reached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed\n",
    "him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him\n",
    "along ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the eddying depths sucked him\n",
    "ten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were wrapped about his head,’\n",
    "and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond\n",
    "the reach of any plummet—‘out of the belly of hell’—when the whale\n",
    "grounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones, even then, God heard the\n",
    "engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the\n",
    "fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale\n",
    "came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the\n",
    "delights of air and earth; and ‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;’\n",
    "when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and\n",
    "beaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring\n",
    "of the ocean—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what was that,\n",
    "shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!\n",
    "\n",
    "“This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of\n",
    "the living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from\n",
    "Gospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God\n",
    "has brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than\n",
    "to appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe\n",

    "from under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,—top-gallant\n",
    "delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his\n",

    "Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there\n",
    "quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some\n",
    "time. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the\n",
    "stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that\n",
    "little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a\n",

    "himself in his heathenish way.\n",

    "But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going\n",
    "to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap\n",
    "began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth\n",
    "page—as I fancied—stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and\n",
    "giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He\n",
    "would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number\n",
    "one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was\n",
    "only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his\n",

    "\n",
    "With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and\n",
    "hideously marred about the face—at least to my taste—his countenance\n",
    "yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You\n",
    "cannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I\n",
    "saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,\n",
    "fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a\n",
    "thousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty\n",
    "bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not\n",
    "altogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never\n",
    "had had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved,\n",
    "his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked\n",
    "more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to\n",
    "decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent\n",
    "one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington’s\n",
    "head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long\n",
    "regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were\n",

    "appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous\n",

    "with the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever;\n",
    "appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.\n",
    "All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there\n",
    "was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand\n",
    "miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only\n",
    "way he could get there—thrown among people as strange to him as though\n",
    "he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;\n",
    "preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;\n",
    "always equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;\n",
    "though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But,\n",
    "perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of\n",
    "so living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man\n",
    "gives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the\n",
    "dyspeptic old woman, he must have “broken his digester.”\n",
    "\n",
    "As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that\n",
    "mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then\n",
    "only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering\n",
    "round the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the\n",
    "storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of\n",
    "strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart\n",
    "and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing\n",
    "savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a\n",
    "nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland\n",
    "deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to\n",
    "feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that\n",
    "would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus\n",
    "drew me. I’ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness\n",
    "has proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some\n",
    "friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At\n",
    "first he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my\n",
    "referring to his last night’s hospitalities, he made out to ask me\n",
    "whether we were again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I\n",
    "thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to\n",
    "him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures\n",
    "that were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we\n",
    "went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to\n",
    "be seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,\n",
    "producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And\n",
    "then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it\n",
    "regularly passing between us.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan’s\n",
    "breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and\n",
    "left us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and\n",
    "unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his\n",
    "forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that\n",
    "henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country’s phrase, that we\n",
    "were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a\n",
    "countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too\n",
    "premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage\n",
    "those old rules would not apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\n",
    "together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his\n",
    "enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some\n",
    "thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\n",
    "mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them\n",
    "towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he\n",
    "silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers’ pockets. I let them stay.\n",
    "He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed\n",
    "the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed\n",
    "anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I\n",
    "deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or\n",
    "otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\n",
    "Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in\n",
    "worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you\n",
    "suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and\n",
    "earth—pagans and all included—can possibly be jealous of an\n",
    "insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?—to do\n",
    "the will of God—_that_ is worship. And what is the will of God?—to do\n",
    "to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me—_that_ is\n",
    "the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish\n",
    "that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular\n",
    "Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him\n",
    "in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped\n",
    "prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with\n",
    "Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that\n",
    "done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences\n",
    "and all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential\n",
    "disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the\n",
    "very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often\n",
    "lie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our\n",
    "hearts’ honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg—a cosy, loving pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 11. Nightgown.\n",
    "\n",
    "We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and\n",
    "Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs\n",
    "over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free\n",
    "and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what\n",
    "little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like\n",
    "getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position\n",
    "began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves\n",
    "sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the\n",
    "head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two\n",
    "noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt\n",
    "very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;\n",
    "indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the\n",
    "room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some\n",
    "small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world\n",
    "that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If\n",
    "you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been\n",
    "so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But\n",
    "if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown\n",
    "of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general\n",
    "consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For\n",
    "this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire,\n",
    "which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height\n",
    "of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket\n",
    "between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there\n",
    "you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at\n",
    "once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether\n",
    "by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always\n",
    "keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of\n",
    "being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright\n",
    "except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper\n",
    "element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey\n",
    "part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and\n",
    "self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the\n",
    "unilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable\n",
    "revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that\n",
    "perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide\n",
    "awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs\n",
    "from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong\n",
    "repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how\n",
    "elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.\n",
    "For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me,\n",
    "even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy\n",
    "then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of\n",
    "insurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential\n",
    "comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.\n",
    "With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the\n",
    "Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue\n",
    "hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to\n",
    "far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island;\n",
    "and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He\n",
    "gladly complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of\n",
    "his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar\n",
    "with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story\n",
    "such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 12. Biographical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and\n",
    "South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a\n",
    "grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\n",
    "sapling; even then, in Queequeg’s ambitious soul, lurked a strong\n",
    "desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or\n",
    "two. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and\n",
    "on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\n",
    "unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal\n",
    "stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he\n",
    "nourished in his untutored youth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Sag Harbor ship visited his father’s bay, and Queequeg sought a\n",
    "passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of\n",
    "seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father’s influence\n",
    "could prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled\n",
    "off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when\n",
    "she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a\n",
    "low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into\n",
    "the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with\n",
    "its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and\n",
    "when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her\n",
    "side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;\n",
    "climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the\n",
    "deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though\n",
    "hacked in pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\n",
    "cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\n",
    "Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\n",
    "wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and\n",
    "told him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage—this\n",
    "sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin. They put him down\n",
    "among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter\n",
    "content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained\n",
    "no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of\n",
    "enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he\n",
    "was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the\n",
    "arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more\n",
    "than that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of\n",
    "whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both\n",
    "miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father’s\n",
    "heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the\n",
    "sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they\n",
    "spent their wages in _that_ place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for\n",
    "lost. Thought he, it’s a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die a\n",
    "pagan.\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,\n",
    "wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer\n",
    "ways about him, though now some time from home.\n",
    "\n",
    "By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having\n",
    "a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he\n",
    "being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not\n",
    "yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians,\n",
    "had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty\n",
    "pagan Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,—as\n",
    "soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he\n",
    "proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They\n",
    "had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a\n",
    "sceptre now.\n",
    "\n",
    "I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\n",
    "movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon\n",
    "this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my\n",
    "intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port\n",
    "for an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to\n",
    "accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the\n",
    "same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my\n",
    "every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of\n",
    "both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection\n",
    "I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,\n",
    "could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was\n",
    "wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted\n",
    "with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.\n",
    "\n",
    "His story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg\n",
    "embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the\n",
    "light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon\n",
    "were sleeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,\n",
    "for a block, I settled my own and comrade’s bill; using, however, my\n",
    "comrade’s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed\n",
    "amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between\n",
    "me and Queequeg—especially as Peter Coffin’s cock and bull stories\n",
    "about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person\n",
    "whom I now companied with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own\n",
    "poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went\n",
    "down to “the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the\n",
    "wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so\n",
    "much—for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\n",
    "streets,—but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\n",
    "heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg\n",
    "now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I\n",
    "asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\n",
    "whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\n",
    "substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet\n",
    "he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of\n",
    "assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate\n",
    "with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and\n",
    "mowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows armed with their own\n",
    "scythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so, Queequeg,\n",
    "for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\n",
    "the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The\n",
    "owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his\n",
    "heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the\n",
    "thing—though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in\n",
    "which to manage the barrow—Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it\n",
    "fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,”\n",
    "said I, “Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would\n",
    "think. Didn’t the people laugh?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\n",
    "Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\n",
    "of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\n",
    "this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\n",
    "mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once\n",
    "touched at Rokovoko, and its commander—from all accounts, a very\n",
    "stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this\n",
    "commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a\n",
    "pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\n",
    "guests were assembled at the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain\n",
    "marches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over\n",
    "against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\n",
    "King, Queequeg’s father. Grace being said,—for those people have their\n",
    "grace as well as we—though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such\n",
    "times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying\n",
    "the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I\n",
    "say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial\n",
    "ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and\n",
    "consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage\n",
    "circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the\n",
    "ceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as having plain\n",
    "precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s own\n",
    "house—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the\n",
    "punchbowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. “Now,” said\n",
    "Queequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our people laugh?”\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the\n",
    "schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one\n",
    "side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees\n",
    "all glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of\n",
    "casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the\n",
    "world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while\n",
    "from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises\n",
    "of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises\n",
    "were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only\n",
    "begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on,\n",
    "for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness\n",
    "of all earthly effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little\n",
    "Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his\n",
    "snortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!—how I spurned that turnpike\n",
    "earth!—that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish\n",
    "heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea\n",
    "which will permit no records.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.\n",
    "His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed\n",
    "teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to\n",
    "the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.\n",
    "Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a\n",
    "wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.\n",
    "So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging\n",
    "bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of\n",
    "the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow\n",
    "beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything\n",
    "more dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies\n",
    "and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come\n",
    "from the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these\n",
    "young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin’s\n",
    "hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught\n",
    "him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,\n",
    "sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern\n",
    "in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet,\n",
    "while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe\n",
    "and passed it to me for a puff.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Capting! Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;\n",
    "“Capting, Capting, here’s the devil.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Hallo, _you_ sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking\n",
    "up to Queequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’t you know\n",
    "you might have killed that chap?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "“He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing\n",
    "to the still shivering greenhorn.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly\n",
    "expression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e\n",
    "so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Look you,” roared the Captain, “I’ll kill-e _you_, you cannibal, if\n",
    "you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to\n",
    "mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted\n",
    "the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to\n",
    "side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor\n",
    "fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all\n",
    "hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,\n",
    "seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in\n",
    "one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of\n",
    "snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable\n",
    "of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing\n",
    "the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the\n",
    "midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and\n",
    "crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured\n",
    "one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso,\n",
    "caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next\n",
    "jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was\n",
    "run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern\n",
    "boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long\n",
    "living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming\n",
    "like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by\n",
    "turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I\n",
    "looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.\n",
    "The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the\n",
    "water, Queequeg, now took an instant’s glance around him, and seeming\n",
    "to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes\n",
    "more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other\n",
    "dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor\n",
    "bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the\n",
    "captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a\n",
    "barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he\n",
    "at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He\n",
    "only asked for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off; that\n",
    "done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the\n",
    "bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to\n",
    "himself—“It’s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We\n",
    "cannibals must help these Christians.”\n",

    "CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a\n",
    "fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of\n",
    "the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely\n",
    "than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it—a mere hillock, and elbow of\n",
    "sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than\n",
    "you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some\n",
    "gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they\n",
    "don’t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have\n",
    "to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that\n",
    "pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true\n",
    "cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,\n",
    "to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an\n",
    "oasis, three blades in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand\n",
    "shoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,\n",
    "belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island\n",
    "of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will\n",
    "sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these\n",
    "extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was\n",
    "settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle\n",
    "swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant\n",
    "Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child\n",
    "borne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the\n",
    "same direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage\n",
    "they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory\n",
    "casket,—the poor little Indian’s skeleton.\n",
    "\n",
    "What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should\n",
    "take to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs\n",
    "in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more\n",
    "experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,\n",
    "launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;\n",
    "put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at\n",
    "Behring’s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared\n",
    "everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the\n",
    "flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea\n",
    "Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that\n",
    "his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and\n",
    "malicious assaults!\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from\n",
    "their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like\n",
    "so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific,\n",
    "and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America\n",
    "add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English\n",
    "overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun;\n",
    "two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer’s. For the sea\n",
    "is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a\n",
    "right of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges;\n",
    "armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though\n",
    "following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships,\n",
    "other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw\n",
    "their living from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone\n",
    "resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to\n",
    "it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.\n",
    "_There_ is his home; _there_ lies his business, which a Noah’s flood\n",
    "would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China.\n",
    "He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among\n",
    "the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years\n",
    "he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells\n",
    "like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.\n",
    "With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to\n",
    "sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight\n",
    "of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his\n",
    "very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.\n",

    "CHAPTER 15. Chowder.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to\n",
    "anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no\n",
    "business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord\n",
    "of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the\n",
    "Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept\n",
    "hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin\n",
    "Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he\n",
    "plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck\n",
    "at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a\n",
    "yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to\n",
    "the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a\n",
    "corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first\n",
    "man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very\n",
    "much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg\n",
    "insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be\n",
    "left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say\n",
    "it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in\n",
    "the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to\n",
    "inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no\n",
    "mistaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses’ ears,\n",
    "swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an\n",
    "old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other\n",
    "side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.\n",
    "Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I\n",
    "could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort\n",
    "of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes,\n",
    "_two_ of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It’s ominous, thinks\n",
    "I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;\n",
    "tombstones staring at me in the whalemen’s chapel; and here a gallows!\n",
    "and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out\n",
    "oblique hints touching Tophet?\n",
    "\n",
    "I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\n",
    "with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,\n",
    "under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured\n",
    "eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen\n",
    "shirt.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There’s Mrs. Hussey.”\n",
    "\n",
    "And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving\n",
    "Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon\n",
    "making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,\n",
    "postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little\n",
    "room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently\n",
    "concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What’s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Clam or Cod?” she repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A clam for supper? a cold clam; is _that_ what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?”\n",
    "says I, “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter\n",
    "time, ain’t it, Mrs. Hussey?”\n",
    "\n",
    "But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple\n",
    "Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing\n",
    "but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading\n",
    "to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us\n",
    "both on one clam?”\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\n",
    "apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder\n",
    "came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!\n",
    "hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than\n",
    "hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up\n",
    "into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully\n",
    "seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the\n",
    "frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing\n",
    "food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we\n",
    "despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and\n",
    "bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey’s clam and cod announcement, I thought I\n",
    "would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered\n",
    "the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few\n",
    "moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different\n",
    "flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I\n",
    "to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What’s\n",
    "that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look,\n",
    "Queequeg, ain’t that a live eel in your bowl? Where’s your harpoon?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its\n",
    "name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for\n",
    "breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you\n",
    "began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area\n",
    "before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a\n",
    "polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account\n",
    "books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the\n",
    "milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning\n",
    "happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen’s\n",
    "boats, I saw Hosea’s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and\n",
    "marching along the sand with each foot in a cod’s decapitated head,\n",
    "looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\n",
    "concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to\n",
    "precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded\n",
    "his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I;\n",
    "“every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because\n",
    "it’s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that\n",
    "unfort’nt v’y’ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with\n",
    "only three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back,\n",
    "with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to\n",
    "take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg”\n",
    "(for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and\n",
    "keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow\n",
    "for breakfast, men?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Both,” says I; “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way of\n",
    "variety.”\n",

    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 16. The Ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no\n",
    "small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\n",
    "diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo\n",
    "had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\n",
    "everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in\n",
    "harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say,\n",
    "Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest\n",
    "wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order\n",
    "to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,\n",
    "I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though\n",
    "it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship\n",
    "myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\n",
    "confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast\n",
    "of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather\n",
    "good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in\n",
    "all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection\n",
    "of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little\n",
    "relied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to\n",
    "carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances\n",
    "produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and\n",
    "accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined\n",
    "rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that\n",
    "trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up\n",
    "with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of\n",
    "Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with\n",
    "Queequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for,\n",
    "though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his\n",
    "liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his\n",
    "tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of\n",
    "shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged\n",
    "sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three\n",
    "ships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the\n",
    "Pequod. _Devil-Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _Tit-bit_ is obvious;\n",
    "_Pequod_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated\n",
    "tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I\n",
    "peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the\n",
    "Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for\n",
    "a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\n",
    "know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\n",
    "galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\n",
    "rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old\n",
    "school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed\n",
    "look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and\n",
    "calms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was darkened like a\n",
    "French grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her\n",
    "venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of\n",
    "Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts\n",
    "stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her\n",
    "ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped\n",
    "flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these\n",
    "her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining\n",
    "to the wild business that for more than half a century she had\n",
    "followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he\n",
    "commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one\n",
    "of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term\n",
    "of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and\n",
    "inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\n",
    "unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler or\n",
    "bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his\n",
    "neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of\n",
    "trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased\n",
    "bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were\n",
    "garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the\n",
    "sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews\n",
    "and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,\n",
    "but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile\n",
    "wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller\n",
    "was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her\n",
    "hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest,\n",
    "felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching\n",
    "its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things\n",
    "are touched with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\n",
    "authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at\n",
    "first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of\n",
    "tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It\n",
    "seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical\n",
    "shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber\n",
    "black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the\n",
    "right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of\n",
    "these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at\n",
    "the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved\n",
    "to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A\n",
    "triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the\n",
    "insider commanded a complete view forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by\n",
    "his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the\n",
    "ship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\n",
    "command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all\n",
    "over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a\n",
    "stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\n",
    "constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of\n",
    "the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,\n",
    "and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;\n",
    "only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest\n",
    "wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his\n",
    "continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\n",
    "windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed\n",
    "together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of\n",
    "the tent.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of\n",
    "him?” he demanded.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I was thinking of shipping.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a\n",
    "stove boat?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“No, Sir, I never have.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?\n",
    "\n",
    "“Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been\n",
    "several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that\n",
    "leg?—I’ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of\n",
    "the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose\n",
    "now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant\n",
    "ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it\n",
    "looks a little suspicious, don’t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast\n",
    "thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of\n",
    "murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of\n",
    "these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated\n",
    "Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather\n",
    "distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the\n",
    "Vineyard.\n",
    "\n",
    "“But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of\n",

    "\n",
    "“Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that’s who ye are speaking to,\n",
    "young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted\n",
    "out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We\n",
    "are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest\n",
    "to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way\n",
    "of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap\n",
    "eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one\n",
    "leg.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed\n",
    "up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a\n",
    "boat!—ah, ah!”\n",
    "\n",
    "I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at\n",
    "the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I\n",
    "could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know\n",
    "there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed\n",
    "I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see; thou\n",
    "dost not talk shark a bit. _Sure_, ye’ve been to sea before now; sure\n",
    "of that?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in\n",
    "the merchant—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant\n",
    "service—don’t aggravate me—I won’t have it. But let us understand each\n",
    "other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel\n",
    "inclined for it?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I do, sir.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live\n",
    "whale’s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to\n",
    "be got rid of, that is; which I don’t take to be the fact.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find\n",
    "out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to\n",
    "see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just\n",
    "step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back\n",
    "to me and tell me what ye see there.”\n",
    "\n",
    "For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\n",
    "knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But\n",
    "concentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started\n",
    "me on the errand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\n",
    "ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\n",
    "pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but\n",
    "exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I\n",
    "could see.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye\n",
    "see?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though,\n",
    "and there’s a squall coming up, I think.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go\n",
    "round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’t ye see the world where\n",
    "you stand?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the\n",
    "Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now\n",
    "repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his\n",
    "willingness to ship me.\n",
    "\n",
    "“And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come\n",
    "along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\n",
    "cabin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\n",
    "surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\n",
    "Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\n",
    "shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\n",
    "of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;\n",
    "each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a\n",
    "nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in\n",
    "whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state\n",
    "stocks bringing in good interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\n",
    "Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\n",
    "this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the\n",
    "peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by\n",
    "things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\n",
    "Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\n",
    "are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\n",
    "Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in\n",
    "childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the\n",
    "Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\n",
    "adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\n",
    "unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\n",
    "unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when\n",
    "these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a\n",
    "globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and\n",
    "seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and\n",
    "beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\n",
    "untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature’s sweet or\n",
    "savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\n",
    "breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\n",
    "advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes\n",
    "one in a whole nation’s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for\n",
    "noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically\n",
    "regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems\n",
    "a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For\n",
    "all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be\n",
    "sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.\n",
    "But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another;\n",
    "and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from\n",
    "another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.\n",
    "But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called\n",
    "serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the\n",
    "veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally\n",
    "educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but\n",
    "all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely\n",
    "island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native\n",
    "born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his\n",
    "vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common\n",
    "consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from\n",
    "conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\n",
    "had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn\n",
    "foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled\n",
    "tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening\n",
    "of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the\n",
    "reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,\n",
    "and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible\n",
    "conclusion that a man’s religion is one thing, and this practical world\n",
    "quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little\n",
    "cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a\n",
    "broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,\n",
    "chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted\n",
    "before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from\n",
    "active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining\n",
    "days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\n",
    "incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\n",
    "task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\n",
    "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\n",
    "upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital,\n",
    "sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,\n",
    "he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used\n",
    "to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an\n",
    "inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When\n",
    "Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking\n",
    "at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch\n",
    "something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at\n",
    "something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished\n",
    "before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian\n",
    "character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no\n",
    "superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like\n",
    "the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\n",
    "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks\n",
    "was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,\n",
    "and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was\n",
    "placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was\n",
    "buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in\n",
    "reading from a ponderous volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been\n",
    "studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\n",
    "certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”\n",
    "\n",
    "As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\n",
    "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\n",
    "and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\n",
    "\n",
    "“He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I _dost_,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.\n",
    "\n",
    "“He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\n",
    "his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,\n",
    "his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said\n",
    "nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,\n",
    "and drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him,\n",
    "and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time\n",
    "to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for\n",
    "the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid\n",
    "no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares\n",
    "of the profits called _lays_, and that these lays were proportioned to\n",
    "the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the\n",
    "ship’s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my\n",
    "own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the\n",
    "sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt\n",
    "that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th\n",
    "lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage,\n",
    "whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was\n",
    "what they call a rather _long lay_, yet it was better than nothing; and\n",
    "if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I\n",
    "would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board,\n",
    "for which I would not have to pay one stiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\n",
    "fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those\n",
    "that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\n",
    "world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this\n",
    "grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the\n",
    "275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been\n",
    "surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a\n",
    "broad-shouldered make.\n",
    "\n",
    "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\n",
    "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\n",
    "something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\n",
    "how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore\n",
    "the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the\n",
    "whole management of the ship’s affairs to these two. And I did not know\n",
    "but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about\n",
    "shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,\n",
    "quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his\n",
    "own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\n",
    "jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he\n",
    "was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded\n",
    "us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “_Lay_ not up for\n",
    "yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay\n",
    "shall we give this young man?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and\n",
    "seventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘where moth and rust do\n",
    "corrupt, but _lay_—’”\n",
    "\n",
    "_Lay_, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\n",
    "seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\n",
    "shall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below, where moth and rust do\n",
    "corrupt. It was an exceedingly _long lay_ that, indeed; and though from\n",
    "the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet\n",
    "the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\n",
    "seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a\n",
    "_teenth_ of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\n",
    "seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven\n",
    "hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to\n",
    "swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting\n",
    "his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there\n",
    "will your heart be also.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do\n",
    "ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n",
    "“Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\n",
    "duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans,\n",
    "many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this\n",
    "young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those\n",
    "orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\n",
    "cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these\n",
    "matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be\n",
    "heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape\n",
    "Horn.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing\n",
    "ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art\n",
    "still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\n",
    "conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering\n",
    "down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\n",
    "insult me. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\n",
    "he’s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me,\n",
    "and start my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat\n",
    "with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,\n",
    "drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”\n",
    "\n",
    "As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\n",
    "marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\n",
    "responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all\n",
    "idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\n",
    "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,\n",
    "I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened\n",
    "wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the\n",
    "transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\n",
    "withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As\n",
    "for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\n",
    "left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a\n",
    "little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the\n",
    "squall’s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at\n",
    "sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs\n",
    "the grindstone. That’s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,\n",
    "Ishmael’s thy name, didn’t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,\n",
    "for the three hundredth lay.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship\n",
    "too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in\n",
    "which he had again been burying himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever\n",
    "whaled it any?” turning to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well, bring him along then.”\n",
    "\n",
    "And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I\n",
    "had done a good morning’s work, and that the Pequod was the identical\n",
    "ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\n",
    "Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\n",
    "indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and\n",
    "receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by\n",
    "arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,\n",
    "and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the\n",
    "captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he\n",
    "does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to\n",
    "the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to\n",
    "have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his\n",
    "hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain\n",
    "Ahab was to be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "“And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It’s all right enough; thou\n",
    "art shipped.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yes, but I should like to see him.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“But I don’t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don’t know\n",
    "exactly what’s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\n",
    "house; a sort of sick, and yet he don’t look so. In fact, he ain’t\n",
    "sick; but no, he isn’t well either. Any how, young man, he won’t always\n",
    "see me, so I don’t suppose he will thee. He’s a queer man, Captain\n",
    "Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou’lt like him well enough; no\n",
    "fear, no fear. He’s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab;\n",

    "like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there’s a\n",
    "good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly;\n",
    "and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind\n",

    "awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was\n",
    "not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did\n",
    "not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed\n",

    "CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Queequeg’s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all\n",
    "day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I\n",
    "cherish the greatest respect towards everybody’s religious obligations,\n",
    "never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue\n",
    "even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other\n",
    "creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of\n",
    "footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the\n",
    "torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the\n",
    "inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these\n",
    "things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,\n",
    "pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these\n",
    "subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most\n",
    "absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;—but what of that? Queequeg\n",
    "thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;\n",
    "and there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let\n",
    "him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—Presbyterians and Pagans\n",
    "alike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and\n",
    "sadly need mending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and\n",
    "rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;\n",
    "but no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.\n",
    "“Queequeg,” said I softly through the key-hole:—all silent. “I say,\n",
    "Queequeg! why don’t you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” But all remained still\n",
    "as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant\n",
    "time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through\n",
    "the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the\n",
    "key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see\n",
    "part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing\n",
    "more. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden\n",
    "shaft of Queequeg’s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous\n",
    "had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That’s strange,\n",
    "thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he\n",
    "seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside\n",
    "here, and no possible mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all still. Something must have happened.\n",
    "Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.\n",
    "Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person\n",
    "I met—the chamber-maid. “La! la!” she cried, “I thought something must\n",
    "be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was\n",
    "locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it’s been just so silent ever\n",
    "since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your\n",
    "baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma’am!—Mistress! murder! Mrs.\n",
    "Hussey! apoplexy!”—and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I\n",
    "following.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a\n",
    "vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation\n",
    "of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy\n",
    "meantime.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and fetch\n",
    "something to pry open the door—the axe!—the axe! he’s had a stroke;\n",
    "depend upon it!”—and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs\n",
    "again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and\n",
    "vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What’s the matter with you, young man?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Get the axe! For God’s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry\n",
    "it open!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Look here,” said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet,\n",
    "so as to have one hand free; “look here; are you talking about prying\n",
    "open any of my doors?”—and with that she seized my arm. “What’s the\n",
    "matter with you? What’s the matter with you, shipmate?”\n",
    "\n",
    "In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand\n",
    "the whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of\n",
    "her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’t\n",
    "seen it since I put it there.” Running to a little closet under the\n",
    "landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that\n",
    "Queequeg’s harpoon was missing. “He’s killed himself,” she cried. “It’s\n",
    "unfort’nate Stiggs done over again—there goes another counterpane—God\n",
    "pity his poor mother!—it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor lad\n",
    "a sister? Where’s that girl?—there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter,\n",
    "and tell him to paint me a sign, with—“no suicides permitted here, and\n",
    "no smoking in the parlor;”—might as well kill both birds at once. Kill?\n",
    "The Lord be merciful to his ghost! What’s that noise there? You, young\n",
    "man, avast there!”\n",
    "\n",
    "And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force\n",
    "open the door.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t allow it; I won’t have my premises spoiled. Go for the\n",
    "locksmith, there’s one about a mile from here. But avast!” putting her\n",
    "hand in her side-pocket, “here’s a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s\n",
    "see.” And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg’s\n",
    "supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Have to burst it open,” said I, and was running down the entry a\n",
    "little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing\n",
    "I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a\n",
    "sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming\n",
    "against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good\n",
    "heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right\n",
    "in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on\n",
    "top of his head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat\n",
    "like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Queequeg,” said I, going up to him, “Queequeg, what’s the matter with\n",
    "you?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He hain’t been a sittin’ so all day, has he?” said the landlady.\n",
    "\n",
    "But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt\n",
    "like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost\n",
    "intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;\n",
    "especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of\n",
    "eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Mrs. Hussey,” said I, “he’s _alive_ at all events; so leave us, if you\n",
    "please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon\n",
    "Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could\n",
    "do—for all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a peg,\n",
    "nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in\n",
    "the slightest way.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do\n",
    "they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;\n",
    "yes, it’s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll\n",
    "get up sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God,\n",
    "and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don’t believe it’s very\n",
    "punctual then.\n",
    "\n",
    "I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long\n",
    "stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,\n",
    "as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or\n",
    "brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only);\n",
    "after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o’clock, I\n",
    "went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg\n",
    "must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there\n",
    "he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began\n",
    "to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to\n",
    "be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,\n",
    "holding a piece of wood on his head.\n",
    "\n",
    "“For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and\n",
    "have some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But\n",
    "not a word did he reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\n",
    "and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\n",
    "turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as\n",
    "it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his\n",
    "ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not\n",
    "get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere\n",
    "thought of Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy\n",
    "position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really\n",
    "wretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide\n",
    "awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\n",
    "\n",
    "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\n",
    "day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\n",
    "had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of\n",
    "sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but\n",
    "with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his\n",
    "forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion,\n",
    "be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any\n",
    "other person, because that other person don’t believe it also. But when\n",
    "a man’s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment\n",
    "to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to\n",
    "lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and\n",
    "argue the point with him.\n",
    "\n",
    "And just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed\n",
    "now, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise\n",
    "and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various\n",
    "religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\n",
    "Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings\n",
    "in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;\n",
    "useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene\n",
    "and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such\n",
    "an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly\n",
    "pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous\n",
    "Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in;\n",
    "hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must\n",
    "necessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic\n",
    "religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In\n",
    "one word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first\n",
    "born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated\n",
    "through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\n",
    "dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\n",
    "in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great\n",
    "feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle\n",
    "wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the\n",
    "afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\n",
    "\n",
    "“No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the\n",
    "inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who\n",
    "had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom,\n",
    "when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in\n",
    "the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were\n",
    "placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,\n",
    "with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,\n",
    "were sent round with the victor’s compliments to all his friends, just\n",
    "as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\n",
    "impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow\n",
    "seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\n",
    "from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\n",
    "than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\n",
    "finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\n",
    "religion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending\n",
    "concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such\n",
    "a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan\n",
    "piety.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\n",
    "breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not\n",
    "make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the\n",
    "Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 18. His Mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg\n",
    "carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us\n",
    "from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,\n",
    "and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that\n",
    "craft, unless they previously produced their papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the\n",
    "bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from\n",
    "behind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted.\n",
    "Son of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present\n",
    "in communion with any Christian church?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here\n",
    "be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at\n",
    "last come to be converted into the churches.\n",
    "\n",
    "“First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in\n",
    "Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out\n",
    "his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana\n",
    "handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the\n",
    "wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at\n",
    "Queequeg.\n",
    "\n",
    "“How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me; “not\n",
    "very long, I rather guess, young man.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it\n",
    "would have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of\n",
    "Deacon Deuteronomy’s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass\n",
    "it every Lord’s day.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said\n",
    "I; “all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First\n",
    "Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain\n",
    "thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same\n",
    "ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,\n",
    "and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us\n",
    "belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole\n",
    "worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some\n",
    "queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in _that_ we all\n",
    "join hands.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Splice, thou mean’st _splice_ hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer.\n",
    "“Young man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast\n",
    "hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father\n",
    "Mapple himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something. Come\n",
    "aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog\n",
    "there—what’s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great\n",
    "anchor, what a harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and\n",
    "he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did\n",
    "you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a\n",
    "fish?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon\n",
    "the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats\n",
    "hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his\n",
    "harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:—\n",
    "\n",
    "“Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,\n",
    "spose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he\n",
    "darted the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the\n",
    "ship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e\n",
    "eye; why, dad whale dead.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close\n",
    "vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin\n",
    "gangway. “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must\n",
    "have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye,\n",
    "Quohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was\n",
    "given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”\n",
    "\n",
    "So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon\n",
    "enrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.\n",
    "\n",
    "When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for\n",
    "signing, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know\n",
    "how to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name\n",

    "Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,\n",
    "and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his\n",
    "broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one\n",
    "entitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in\n",
    "Queequeg’s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,\n",
    "looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son of darkness, I must do\n",
    "my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for\n",
    "the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways,\n",
    "which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial\n",
    "bondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the\n",

    "\n",
    "“Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,”\n",
    "cried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the\n",

    "sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out\n",
    "of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never\n",
    "came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he\n",
    "shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case\n",
    "he got stove and went to Davy Jones.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself,\n",
    "as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what\n",
    "it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this\n",
    "ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this\n",
    "same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on\n",
    "Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did’st\n",
    "thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?”\n",

    "“Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and\n",
    "thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye.\n",
    "Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death\n",
    "and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an\n",
    "everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over\n",
    "us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to\n",
    "think about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking\n",
    "of; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the\n",
    "nearest port; that was what I was thinking of.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where\n",
    "we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some\n",
    "sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he\n",
    "stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which\n",

    "board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything\n",
    "betokened that the ship’s preparations were hurrying to a close.\n",
    "Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam\n",
    "keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing\n",

    "forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are\n",
    "indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling,\n",
    "which necessitates a three-years’ housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far\n",
    "from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And\n",
    "though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means\n",
    "to the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of\n",
    "the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution\n",
    "of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote\n",
    "harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,\n",
    "whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and\n",

    "\n",
    "At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the\n",
    "Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,\n",
    "fuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time\n",

    "could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after\n",
    "once fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come on board with a\n",
    "jar of pickles for the steward’s pantry; another time with a bunch of\n",
    "quills for the chief mate’s desk, where he kept his log; a third time\n",
    "with a roll of flannel for the small of some one’s rheumatic back.\n",
    "Never did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity—Aunt\n",
    "Charity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this\n",
    "charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn\n",
    "her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,\n",
    "and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother\n",
    "Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of\n",
    "well-saved dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on\n",
    "board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and\n",
    "a still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor\n",
    "Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him\n",
    "a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down\n",
    "went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a\n",
    "while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men\n",
    "down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and\n",
    "then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.\n",
    "\n",
    "During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the\n",
    "craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and\n",
    "when he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they\n",
    "would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected\n",
    "aboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could\n",
    "attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I\n",
    "had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly\n",
    "in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so\n",
    "long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the\n",
    "absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open\n",
    "sea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he\n",
    "be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up\n",
    "his suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I\n",
    "said nothing, and tried to think nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would\n",
    "certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early\n",

    "“Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close\n",
    "behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating\n",
    "himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain\n",
    "twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Going aboard?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Hands off, will you,” said I.\n",
    "\n",

    "“Ain’t going aboard, then?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yes, we are,” said I, “but what business is that of yours? Do you\n",
    "know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of that,” said Elijah, slowly and\n",
    "wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable\n",
    "glances.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Elijah,” said I, “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We\n",
    "are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be\n",
    "detained.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He’s cracked, Queequeg,” said I, “come on.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few\n",
    "paces.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Never mind him,” said I, “Queequeg, come on.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my\n",
    "shoulder, said—“Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that\n",
    "ship a while ago?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes,\n",
    "I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Very dim, very dim,” said Elijah. “Morning to ye.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and\n",
    "touching my shoulder again, said, “See if you can find ’em now, will\n",
    "ye?\n",
    "\n",
    "“Find who?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Morning to ye! morning to ye!” he rejoined, again moving off. “Oh! I\n",
    "was going to warn ye against—but never mind, never mind—it’s all one,\n",
    "all in the family too;—sharp frost this morning, ain’t it? Good-bye to\n",
    "ye. Shan’t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it’s before the\n",
    "Grand Jury.” And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving\n",
    "me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound\n",
    "quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the\n",
    "hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward\n",
    "to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a\n",
    "light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a\n",
    "tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his\n",
    "face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber\n",
    "slept upon him.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?” said I,\n",
    "looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the\n",
    "wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I\n",
    "would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\n",
    "matter, were it not for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question. But I\n",
    "beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to\n",
    "Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to\n",
    "establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper’s rear,\n",
    "as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado,\n",
    "sat quietly down there.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Gracious! Queequeg, don’t sit there,” said I.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh! perry dood seat,” said Queequeg, “my country way; won’t hurt him\n",
    "face.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Face!” said I, “call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;\n",
    "but how hard he breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you\n",
    "are heavy, it’s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look,\n",
    "he’ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don’t wake.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\n",
    "lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\n",
    "over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning\n",
    "him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\n",
    "land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,\n",

    "At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship’s\n",
    "riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and\n",
    "after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with\n",
    "her last gift—a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her\n",
    "brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward—after all this, the\n",
    "two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to\n",
    "the chief mate, Peleg said:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is\n",
    "all ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore, eh?\n",

    "quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as\n",
    "well as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign\n",
    "of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But\n",
    "then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in\n",
    "getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,\n",
    "as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he\n",
    "was not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab\n",
    "stayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the\n",
    "merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a\n",
    "considerable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the\n",
    "cabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,\n",
    "before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.\n",

    "But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain\n",

    "\n",
    "“Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at\n",
    "the main-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before, this\n",
    "whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the\n",
    "Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known\n",
    "to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next command, and\n",
    "the crew sprang for the handspikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot\n",
    "is the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be\n",
    "it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed\n",
    "pilots of the port—he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot\n",
    "in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was\n",
    "concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft—Bildad, I say, might\n",
    "now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the\n",
    "approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave\n",
    "of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some\n",
    "sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good\n",
    "will. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that\n",
    "no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in\n",
    "getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice\n",
    "copy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\n",
    "and swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he\n",
    "would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I\n",
    "paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of\n",
    "the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for\n",
    "a pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in\n",
    "pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred\n",
    "and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,\n",
    "and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in\n",
    "the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my\n",
    "first kick.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared.\n",
    "“Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye\n",
    "spring, I say, all of ye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red\n",
    "whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I\n",
    "say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!” And so saying, he moved\n",
    "along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while\n",

    "Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It\n",
    "was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into\n",
    "night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose\n",
    "freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of\n",
    "teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white\n",
    "ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from\n",
    "the bows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as\n",

    "\n",
    "It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even\n",
    "modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their\n",
    "functions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called,\n",
    "and there may be a castor of state. How they use the salt,\n",
    "precisely—who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king’s head is\n",
    "solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be,\n",
    "though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run\n",
    "well, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here,\n",

    "\n",
    "The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a\n",
    "Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an\n",
    "icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being\n",
    "hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood\n",
    "would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time\n",
    "of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which\n",
    "his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those\n",
    "summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his\n",
    "thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties\n",
    "and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was\n",
    "merely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking;\n",
    "quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and\n",
    "closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,\n",
    "like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for\n",
    "long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow\n",
    "or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was\n",
    "warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed\n",
    "to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he\n",
    "had calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life\n",
    "for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame\n",
    "chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there\n",
    "were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some\n",
    "cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly\n",
    "conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,\n",
    "the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline\n",
    "him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some\n",
    "organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than\n",
    "from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And\n",
    "if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more\n",
    "did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,\n",
    "tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,\n",
    "and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some\n",
    "honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often\n",
    "evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I\n",
    "will have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a\n",
    "whale.” By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and\n",
    "useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the\n",
    "encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more\n",
    "dangerous comrade than a coward.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as\n",
    "careful a man as you’ll find anywhere in this fishery.” But we shall\n",
    "ere long see what that word “careful” precisely means when used by a\n",
    "man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a\n",
    "sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon\n",
    "all mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in\n",
    "this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits\n",
    "of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly\n",
    "wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after\n",
    "sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted\n",
    "in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical\n",
    "ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for\n",
    "theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.\n",
    "What doom was his own father’s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could\n",
    "he find the torn limbs of his brother?\n",
    "\n",
    "With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\n",
    "superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which\n",
    "could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But\n",
    "it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such\n",
    "terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature\n",
    "that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in\n",
    "him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its\n",
    "confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it\n",
    "was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,\n",
    "while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or\n",
    "whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet\n",
    "cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,\n",
    "which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged\n",
    "and mighty man.\n",
    "\n",
    "But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete\n",
    "abasement of poor Starbuck’s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart\n",
    "to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose\n",
    "the fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint\n",
    "stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;\n",
    "men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble\n",
    "and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any\n",
    "ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their\n",
    "costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so\n",
    "far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character\n",
    "seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a\n",
    "valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,\n",
    "completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But\n",
    "this august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes,\n",
    "but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt\n",
    "see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that\n",
    "democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God;\n",
    "Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all\n",
    "democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!\n",
    "\n",
    "If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall\n",
    "hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic\n",
    "graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among\n",
    "them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall\n",
    "touch that workman’s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a\n",
    "rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics\n",
    "bear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one\n",
    "royal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou\n",
    "great democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict,\n",
    "Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly\n",
    "hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old\n",
    "Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who\n",
    "didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a\n",
    "throne! Thou who, in all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest\n",
    "Thy selectest champions from the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O\n",

    "\n",
    "Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,\n",
    "according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;\n",
    "neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an\n",
    "indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the\n",
    "chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged\n",
    "for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his\n",
    "whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his\n",
    "crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable\n",
    "arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about\n",
    "the snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very\n",
    "death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and\n",
    "off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his\n",
    "old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated\n",
    "monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death\n",
    "into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there is no\n",
    "telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;\n",
    "but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a\n",
    "comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a\n",
    "sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,\n",
    "about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and\n",
    "not sooner.\n",
    "\n",
    "What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,\n",
    "unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a\n",
    "world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;\n",
    "what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that\n",
    "thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black\n",
    "little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would\n",
    "almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his\n",
    "nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready\n",
    "loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever\n",
    "he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from\n",
    "the other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in\n",
    "readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his\n",
    "legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his\n",
    "peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,\n",
    "whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless\n",
    "miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in\n",
    "time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated\n",
    "handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal\n",
    "tribulations, Stubb’s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of\n",
    "disinfecting agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s Vineyard. A\n",
    "short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,\n",
    "who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally\n",
    "and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of\n",
    "honor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost\n",
    "was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic\n",
    "bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of\n",
    "any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,\n",
    "the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least\n",
    "water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small\n",
    "application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This\n",
    "ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in\n",
    "the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a\n",
    "three years’ voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted\n",
    "that length of time. As a carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought\n",
    "nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask\n",
    "was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They\n",
    "called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could\n",
    "be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in\n",
    "Arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers\n",
    "inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions\n",
    "of those battering seas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now these three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.\n",
    "They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the\n",
    "Pequod’s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which\n",
    "Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the\n",
    "whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being\n",
    "armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio\n",
    "of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic\n",
    "Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,\n",
    "who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the\n",
    "former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and\n",
    "moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy\n",
    "and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set\n",
    "down who the Pequod’s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of\n",
    "them belonged.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected\n",
    "for his squire. But Queequeg is already known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly\n",
    "promontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists the last\n",
    "remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the\n",
    "neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring\n",
    "harpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of\n",
    "Gay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,\n",
    "and black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but\n",
    "Antarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently\n",
    "proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud\n",
    "warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had\n",
    "scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer\n",
    "snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now\n",
    "hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon\n",
    "of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To look\n",
    "at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have\n",
    "credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and\n",
    "half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers\n",
    "of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate’s squire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\n",
    "negro-savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended\n",
    "from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called\n",
    "them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to\n",
    "them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,\n",
    "lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been\n",
    "anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors\n",
    "most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold\n",
    "life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what\n",
    "manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,\n",
    "and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six\n",
    "feet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at\n",
    "him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to\n",
    "beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro,\n",
    "Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a\n",
    "chess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod’s company, be it\n",
    "said, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men\n",
    "before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans\n",
    "born, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same\n",
    "with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military\n",
    "and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the\n",
    "construction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say,\n",
    "because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the\n",
    "brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No\n",
    "small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the\n",
    "outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews\n",
    "from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the\n",
    "Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland\n",
    "Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage\n",
    "homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling,\n",
    "but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all\n",
    "Islanders in the Pequod, _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not\n",
    "acknowledging the common continent of men, but each _Isolato_ living on\n",
    "a separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel,\n",
    "what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from\n",
    "all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying\n",
    "Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world’s grievances before that bar\n",
    "from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip—he\n",
    "never did—oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim\n",
    "Pequod’s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine;\n",
    "prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck\n",
    "on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in\n",
    "glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!\n",

    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 28. Ahab.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was\n",
    "seen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the\n",
    "watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed\n",
    "to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from\n",
    "the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was\n",
    "plain they but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and\n",
    "dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to\n",
    "penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly\n",
    "gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague\n",
    "disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the\n",
    "sea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at\n",
    "times by the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly\n",
    "recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived\n",
    "of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was\n",
    "almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish\n",
    "prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or\n",
    "uneasiness—to call it so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look\n",
    "about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such\n",
    "emotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,\n",
    "were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the\n",
    "tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me\n",
    "acquainted with, still I ascribed this—and rightly ascribed it—to the\n",
    "fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation\n",
    "in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the\n",
    "aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was\n",
    "most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and\n",
    "induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.\n",
    "Three better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own\n",
    "different way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of\n",
    "them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being\n",
    "Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had\n",
    "biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the\n",
    "southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,\n",
    "gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable\n",
    "weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey\n",
    "and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the\n",
    "ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping\n",
    "and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of\n",
    "the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the\n",
    "taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;\n",
    "Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\n",
    "recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when\n",
    "the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,\n",
    "or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His\n",
    "whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an\n",
    "unalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out\n",
    "from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his\n",
    "tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you\n",
    "saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that\n",
    "perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a\n",
    "great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and\n",
    "without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from\n",
    "top to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still\n",
    "greenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or\n",
    "whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could\n",
    "certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or\n",
    "no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once\n",
    "Tashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,\n",
    "superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did\n",
    "Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the\n",
    "fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this\n",
    "wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman\n",
    "insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out\n",
    "of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless,\n",
    "the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested\n",
    "this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no\n",
    "white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever\n",
    "Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to\n",
    "pass, so he muttered—then, whoever should do that last office for the\n",
    "dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.\n",
    "\n",
    "So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the\n",
    "livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly\n",
    "noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the\n",
    "barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come\n",
    "to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished\n",
    "bone of the sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,” said\n",
    "the old Gay-Head Indian once; “but like his dismasted craft, he shipped\n",
    "another mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of ’em.”\n",
    "\n",
    "I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of\n",
    "the Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\n",
    "there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\n",
    "plank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\n",
    "holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\n",
    "beyond the ship’s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest\n",
    "fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and\n",
    "fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor\n",
    "did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest\n",
    "gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not\n",
    "painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not\n",
    "only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion\n",
    "in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some\n",
    "mighty woe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.\n",
    "But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either\n",
    "standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or\n",
    "heavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to\n",
    "grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,\n",
    "when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry\n",
    "bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it\n",
    "came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,\n",
    "for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he\n",
    "seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only\n",
    "making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\n",
    "preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so\n",
    "that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite\n",
    "Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that\n",
    "layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose\n",
    "the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\n",
    "pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him\n",
    "from his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and\n",
    "May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,\n",
    "ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some\n",
    "few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,\n",
    "in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish\n",
    "air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,\n",
    "which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.\n",

    "Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went\n",
    "rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost\n",
    "perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the\n",

    "redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped\n",
    "up—flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights\n",
    "seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely\n",
    "pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted\n",
    "suns! For sleeping man, ’twas hard to choose between such winsome days\n",
    "and such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning\n",
    "weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward\n",
    "world. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild\n",
    "hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice\n",
    "most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more\n",

    "Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less\n",
    "man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,\n",
    "the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the\n",
    "night-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he\n",
    "seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits\n",
    "were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. “It feels\n",
    "like going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an\n",

    "grave-dug berth.”\n",
    "\n",
    "So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were\n",
    "set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;\n",
    "and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors\n",
    "flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt\n",
    "it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when\n",
    "this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the\n",
    "silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old\n",
    "man would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled\n",
    "way. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like\n",
    "these, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because\n",
    "to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory\n",
    "heel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony\n",
    "step, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of\n",
    "sharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;\n",
    "and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from\n",
    "taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below,\n",
    "with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if\n",
    "Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say\n",
    "nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting\n",
    "something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\n",
    "insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know\n",
    "Ahab then.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that\n",
    "fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;\n",
    "where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at\n",
    "last.—Down, dog, and kennel!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly\n",
    "scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,\n",

    "like it, sir.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,\n",

    "back and strike him, or—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for\n",
    "him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the\n",
    "first time I ever _did_ pray. It’s queer; very queer; and he’s queer\n",
    "too; aye, take him fore and aft, he’s about the queerest old man Stubb\n",

    "sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and\n",

    "kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And\n",

    "curious all dreams are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow\n",

    "base kick. Besides,’ thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the\n",

    "round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he\n",
    "had for a clout—what do you think, I saw?—why thunder alive, man, his\n",
    "stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on\n",

    "eating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to\n",
    "stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise Stubb,’ I thought I might as\n",
    "well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my\n",
    "foot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I,\n",
    "‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye here,’ says he; ‘let’s\n",
    "argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’\n",

    "what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above\n",
    "cited extracts will show.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen\n",
    "ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional\n",
    "harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate\n",
    "subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing\n",
    "authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great\n",
    "sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy\n",
    "mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper\n",
    "upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of\n",
    "the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the\n",
    "profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the\n",
    "then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to\n",
    "this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats\n",
    "and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference\n",
    "to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past\n",
    "days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was\n",
    "to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a\n",
    "new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,—the\n",
    "Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm whale now reigneth!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the\n",
    "living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest\n",
    "degree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s;\n",
    "both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both\n",
    "exact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to\n",
    "be found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes,\n",
    "it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific\n",
    "description. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic,\n",
    "lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted\n",
    "whales, his is an unwritten life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular\n",
    "comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the\n",
    "present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent\n",
    "laborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I\n",
    "hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete;\n",
    "because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very\n",
    "reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical\n",
    "description of the various species, or—in this place at least—to much\n",
    "of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of\n",
    "a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the\n",
    "Post-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea\n",
    "after them; to have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations,\n",
    "ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I\n",
    "that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful\n",
    "tauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a\n",
    "covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam\n",
    "through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with\n",
    "whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There\n",
    "are some preliminaries to settle.\n",
    "\n",
    "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\n",
    "is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it\n",
    "still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of\n",
    "Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby separate the whales from\n",
    "the fish.” But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,\n",
    "sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnæus’s express edict,\n",
    "were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the\n",
    "Leviathan.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from\n",
    "the waters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular\n",
    "heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem\n",
    "intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure\n",
    "meritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley\n",
    "Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and\n",
    "they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether\n",
    "insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\n",
    "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\n",
    "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\n",
    "respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given\n",
    "you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;\n",
    "whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\n",
    "conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a\n",
    "whale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him.\n",
    "However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\n",
    "meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a\n",
    "fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is\n",
    "still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have\n",
    "noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a\n",
    "vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,\n",
    "though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\n",
    "position.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\n",
    "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\n",
    "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\n",
    "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\n",
    "alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\n",
    "must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the\n",
    "grand divisions of the entire whale host.\n",
    "\n",
    "*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and\n",
    "Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are\n",
    "included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish\n",
    "are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers,\n",
    "and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny\n",
    "their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their\n",
    "passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.\n",
    "\n",
    "First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary\n",
    "BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them\n",
    "all, both small and large.\n",

    "English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter\n",
    "whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the\n",
    "French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the\n",
    "Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;\n",
    "the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in\n",
    "aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the\n",
    "only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is\n",
    "obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged\n",
    "upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically\n",
    "considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was\n",
    "almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil\n",
    "was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days\n",
    "spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a\n",
    "creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland\n",
    "or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was\n",
    "that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable\n",
    "of the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was\n",
    "exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment\n",
    "and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you\n",
    "nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of\n",
    "time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was\n",
    "still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a\n",
    "notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation\n",
    "must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this\n",
    "spermaceti was really derived.\n",

    "BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER II. (_Right Whale_).—In one respect this is\n",
    "the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly\n",
    "hunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or\n",
    "baleen; and the oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior article\n",
    "in commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by\n",
    "all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black\n",
    "Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a\n",
    "deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus\n",
    "multitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in\n",
    "the second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the\n",
    "English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the\n",
    "Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the\n",
    "Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been\n",
    "hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale\n",
    "which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on\n",
    "the Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various other parts of\n",
    "the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the\n",
    "English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree\n",
    "in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single\n",
    "determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by\n",
    "endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that\n",
    "some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate.\n",
    "The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with\n",
    "reference to elucidating the sperm whale.\n",
    "\n",
    "BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER III. (_Fin-Back_).—Under this head I reckon\n",
    "a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\n",
    "Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\n",
    "whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\n",
    "Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and\n",
    "in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\n",
    "portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great\n",
    "lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting\n",
    "folds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,\n",
    "from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin\n",
    "is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder\n",
    "part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\n",
    "end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,\n",
    "this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the\n",
    "surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with\n",
    "spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows\n",
    "upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery\n",
    "circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and\n",
    "wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes\n",
    "back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some\n",
    "men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly\n",
    "rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his\n",
    "straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear\n",
    "upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in\n",
    "swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems\n",
    "the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark\n",
    "that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the\n",
    "Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic\n",
    "species denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of\n",
    "these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several\n",
    "varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales\n",
    "and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed\n",
    "whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of\n",
    "great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\n",
    "convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is\n",
    "in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded\n",
    "upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that\n",
    "those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to\n",
    "afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other\n",
    "detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.\n",
    "How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose\n",
    "peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,\n",
    "without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in\n",
    "other and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the\n",
    "humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.\n",
    "Then, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these\n",
    "has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the\n",
    "same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,\n",
    "they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of\n",
    "them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all\n",
    "general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one\n",
    "of the whale-naturalists has split.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the\n",
    "whale, in his anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the\n",
    "right classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the\n",
    "Greenland whale’s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have\n",
    "seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\n",
    "Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various\n",
    "leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as\n",
    "available to the systematizer as those external ones already\n",
    "enumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales\n",
    "bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.\n",
    "And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only\n",
    "one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.\n",

    "BOOK I. (_Folio_) CHAPTER IV. (_Hump Back_).—This whale is often seen\n",
    "on the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there,\n",
    "and towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or\n",
    "you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the\n",
    "popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the\n",
    "sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very\n",

    "at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and\n",
    "then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is\n",
    "never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are\n",

    "carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale\n",
    "averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost\n",

    "profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the\n",
    "Hyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic\n",
    "employment—as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and\n",
    "quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.\n",

    "creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five\n",
    "feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly\n",
    "speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw\n",
    "in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found\n",
    "on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner\n",
    "something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What\n",
    "precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to\n",
    "say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and\n",
    "bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for\n",
    "a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin\n",
    "said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the\n",
    "surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his\n",
    "horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these\n",
    "surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided\n",

    "CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place\n",
    "as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising\n",
    "from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown\n",
    "of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced\n",
    "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\n",
    "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the\n",
    "person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\n",
    "officer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\n",
    "usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In\n",
    "those days, the captain’s authority was restricted to the navigation\n",
    "and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\n",
    "department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer\n",
    "reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\n",
    "title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\n",
    "his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as\n",
    "senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain’s more\n",
    "inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\n",
    "harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\n",
    "in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the\n",
    "boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling\n",
    "ground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand\n",
    "political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart\n",
    "from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\n",
    "professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\n",
    "their social equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\n",
    "this—the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\n",
    "merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\n",
    "so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\n",
    "the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in\n",
    "the captain’s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with\n",
    "it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest\n",
    "of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and\n",
    "the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high\n",
    "or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their\n",
    "common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and\n",
    "hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a\n",
    "less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind\n",
    "how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some\n",
    "primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious\n",
    "externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,\n",
    "and in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in\n",
    "which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated\n",
    "grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as\n",
    "much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the\n",
    "shabbiest of pilot-cloth.\n",
    "\n",
    "And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least\n",
    "given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage\n",
    "he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he\n",
    "required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the\n",
    "quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar\n",
    "circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he\n",
    "addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or _in\n",
    "terrorem_, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means\n",
    "unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind\n",
    "those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;\n",
    "incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than\n",
    "they were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of\n",
    "his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested;\n",
    "through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an\n",
    "irresistible dictatorship. For be a man’s intellectual superiority what\n",
    "it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over\n",
    "other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and\n",
    "entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.\n",
    "This it is, that for ever keeps God’s true princes of the Empire from\n",
    "the world’s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can\n",
    "give, to those men who become famous more through their infinite\n",
    "inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than\n",
    "through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.\n",
    "Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political\n",
    "superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot\n",
    "imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of\n",
    "Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an\n",
    "imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the\n",
    "tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would\n",
    "depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing,\n",
    "ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one\n",
    "now alluded to.\n",

    "But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket\n",
    "grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and\n",
    "Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old\n",
    "whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings\n",
    "and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it\n",
    "must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and\n",

    "CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale\n",
    "loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord\n",
    "and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking\n",
    "an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on\n",
    "the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on\n",
    "the upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the\n",
    "tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But\n",
    "presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the\n",
    "deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr.\n",
    "Starbuck,” disappears into the cabin.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away, and Starbuck,\n",
    "the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then\n",
    "Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,\n",
    "and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of\n",
    "pleasantness, “Dinner, Mr. Stubb,” and descends the scuttle. The second\n",
    "Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the\n",
    "main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important\n",
    "rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid “Dinner,\n",
    "Mr. Flask,” follows after his predecessors.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\n",
    "seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\n",
    "sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his\n",
    "shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right\n",
    "over the Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching\n",
    "his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so\n",
    "far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other\n",
    "processions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into\n",
    "the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,\n",
    "then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence,\n",
    "in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\n",
    "artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\n",
    "some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\n",
    "defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\n",
    "very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that\n",
    "same commander’s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say\n",
    "deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the\n",
    "table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this\n",
    "difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of\n",
    "Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,\n",
    "therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he\n",
    "who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own\n",
    "private dinner-table of invited guests, that man’s unchallenged power\n",
    "and dominion of individual influence for the time; that man’s royalty\n",
    "of state transcends Belshazzar’s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.\n",
    "Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Cæsar.\n",
    "It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.\n",
    "Now, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a\n",
    "ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that\n",
    "peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion\n",
    "on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still\n",
    "deferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be\n",
    "served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\n",
    "there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,\n",
    "their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he carved\n",
    "the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they\n",
    "would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even\n",
    "upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his\n",
    "knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab\n",
    "thereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards him, the mate received his\n",
    "meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little\n",
    "started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed\n",
    "it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like\n",
    "the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor\n",
    "profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals\n",
    "were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old\n",
    "Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief\n",
    "it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold\n",
    "below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy\n",
    "of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef;\n",
    "his would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help\n",
    "himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the\n",
    "first degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never\n",
    "more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\n",
    "nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask\n",
    "helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.\n",
    "Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he\n",
    "thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its\n",
    "clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so\n",
    "long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and\n",
    "therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas!\n",
    "was a butterless man!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask\n",
    "is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was badly\n",
    "jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;\n",
    "and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb\n",
    "even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small\n",
    "appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask\n",
    "must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that\n",
    "day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the\n",
    "deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever\n",
    "since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he\n",
    "had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.\n",
    "For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal\n",
    "in him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed\n",
    "from my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of\n",
    "old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before\n",
    "the mast. There’s the fruits of promotion now; there’s the vanity of\n",
    "glory: there’s the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any\n",
    "mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask’s\n",
    "official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\n",
    "vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\n",
    "through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\n",
    "awful Ahab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table\n",
    "in the Pequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted\n",
    "order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was\n",
    "restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the\n",
    "three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary\n",
    "legatees. They made a sort of temporary servants’ hall of the high and\n",
    "mighty cabin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\n",
    "invisible domineerings of the captain’s table, was the entire care-free\n",
    "license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior\n",
    "fellows the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid\n",
    "of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed\n",
    "their food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined\n",
    "like lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading\n",
    "with spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that\n",
    "to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale\n",
    "Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly\n",
    "quarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he\n",
    "did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an\n",
    "ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,\n",
    "harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted\n",
    "Dough-Boy’s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head\n",
    "into a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand,\n",
    "began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was\n",
    "naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this\n",
    "bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital\n",
    "nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab,\n",
    "and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,\n",
    "Dough-Boy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after\n",
    "seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he\n",
    "would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and\n",
    "fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was\n",
    "over.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\n",
    "his filed teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\n",
    "the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the\n",
    "low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low\n",
    "cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in\n",
    "a ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,\n",
    "not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\n",
    "small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so\n",
    "broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage\n",
    "fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through\n",
    "his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by\n",
    "beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a\n",
    "mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so\n",
    "much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any\n",
    "marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\n",
    "Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might\n",
    "be picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery\n",
    "hanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor\n",
    "did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for\n",
    "their lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner,\n",
    "they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did\n",
    "not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget\n",
    "that in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\n",
    "guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy!\n",
    "hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin\n",
    "should he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his\n",
    "great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to\n",
    "his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling\n",
    "in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\n",
    "there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\n",
    "scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,\n",
    "when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\n",
    "captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights\n",
    "the ship’s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that\n",
    "anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,\n",
    "the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to\n",
    "have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it\n",
    "was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a\n",
    "moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,\n",
    "residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin\n",
    "was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally\n",
    "included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He\n",
    "lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\n",
    "Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan\n",
    "of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the\n",
    "winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old\n",
    "age, Ahab’s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed\n",
    "upon the sullen paws of its gloom!\n",

    "CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the\n",
    "other seamen my first mast-head came round.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\n",
    "simultaneously with the vessel’s leaving her port; even though she may\n",
    "have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper\n",
    "cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she\n",
    "is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her—say, an empty vial\n",
    "even—then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her\n",
    "skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether\n",
    "relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\n",
    "very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\n",
    "here. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\n",
    "Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\n",
    "For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by\n",
    "their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,\n",
    "or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great\n",
    "stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the\n",
    "dread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel\n",
    "builders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a\n",
    "nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general\n",
    "belief among archæologists, that the first pyramids were founded for\n",
    "astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar\n",
    "stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with\n",
    "prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were\n",
    "wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the\n",
    "look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing\n",
    "in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,\n",
    "who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole\n",
    "latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the\n",
    "ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a\n",
    "dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his\n",
    "place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing\n",
    "everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern\n",
    "standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\n",
    "and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\n",
    "are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\n",
    "discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of\n",
    "the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and\n",
    "fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\n",
    "whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great\n",
    "Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\n",
    "Baltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars, his column marks that\n",
    "point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral\n",
    "Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\n",
    "Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\n",
    "token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\n",
    "smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\n",
    "Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to\n",
    "befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;\n",
    "however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the\n",
    "thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be\n",
    "shunned.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\n",
    "standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not\n",
    "so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\n",
    "historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,\n",
    "that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly\n",
    "launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected\n",
    "lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by\n",
    "means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house.\n",
    "A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New\n",
    "Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned\n",
    "boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we\n",
    "then to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The\n",
    "three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen\n",
    "taking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other\n",
    "every two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly\n",
    "pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is\n",
    "delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks,\n",
    "striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while\n",
    "beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters\n",
    "of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous\n",
    "Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of\n",
    "the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship\n",
    "indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you\n",
    "into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime\n",
    "uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras\n",
    "with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into\n",
    "unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\n",
    "securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what\n",
    "you shall have for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more\n",
    "are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’\n",
    "voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the\n",
    "mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be\n",
    "deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion\n",
    "of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of\n",
    "anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a\n",
    "comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,\n",
    "a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small\n",
    "and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your\n",
    "most usual point of perch is the head of the t’ gallant-mast, where you\n",
    "stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)\n",
    "called the t’ gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the\n",
    "beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull’s horns. To\n",
    "be sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in\n",
    "the shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest\n",
    "watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul\n",
    "is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about\n",
    "in it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing\n",
    "(like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a\n",
    "watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or\n",
    "additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of\n",
    "drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of\n",
    "your watch-coat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\n",
    "southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or\n",
    "pulpits, called _crow’s-nests_, in which the look-outs of a Greenland\n",
    "whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In\n",
    "the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the\n",
    "Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\n",
    "re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in this\n",
    "admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a\n",
    "charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\n",
    "_crow’s-nest_ of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s\n",
    "good craft. He called it the _Sleet’s crow’s-nest_, in honor of\n",
    "himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all\n",
    "ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children\n",
    "after our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and\n",
    "patentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other\n",
    "apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something\n",
    "like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is\n",
    "furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head\n",
    "in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into\n",
    "it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or\n",
    "side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker\n",
    "underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather\n",
    "rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and\n",
    "other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his\n",
    "mast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a\n",
    "rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask\n",
    "and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or\n",
    "vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\n",
    "successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the\n",
    "water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it\n",
    "was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does,\n",
    "all the little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he\n",
    "so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very\n",
    "scientific account of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small\n",
    "compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors\n",
    "resulting from what is called the “local attraction” of all binnacle\n",
    "magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in\n",
    "the ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s case, perhaps, to there having\n",
    "been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though\n",
    "the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his\n",
    "learned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass observations,” and\n",
    "“approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was\n",
    "not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail\n",
    "being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little\n",
    "case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest, within\n",
    "easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and\n",
    "even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it\n",
    "very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,\n",
    "seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while\n",
    "with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics\n",
    "aloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches of the\n",
    "pole.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as\n",
    "Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is\n",
    "greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\n",
    "seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used\n",
    "to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a\n",
    "chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;\n",
    "then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the\n",
    "top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so\n",
    "at last mount to my ultimate destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept\n",
    "but sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how\n",
    "could I—being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering\n",
    "altitude—how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all\n",
    "whale-ships’ standing orders, “Keep your weather eye open, and sing out\n",
    "every time.”\n",
    "\n",
    "And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of\n",
    "Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with\n",
    "lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who\n",
    "offers to ship with the Phædon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware\n",
    "of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be\n",
    "killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes\n",
    "round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor\n",
    "are these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery\n",
    "furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded\n",
    "young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking\n",
    "sentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches\n",
    "himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,\n",
    "and in moody phrase ejaculates:—\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "“Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand\n",
    "blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young\n",
    "philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient\n",
    "“interest” in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost\n",
    "to all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would\n",
    "rather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young\n",
    "Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are\n",
    "short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have\n",
    "left their opera-glasses at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why, thou monkey,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads, “we’ve been\n",
    "cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale\n",
    "yet. Whales are scarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here.”\n",
    "Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in\n",
    "the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of\n",
    "vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending\n",
    "cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;\n",
    "takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,\n",
    "blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange,\n",
    "half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every\n",
    "dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him\n",
    "the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by\n",
    "continually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit\n",
    "ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space;\n",
    "like Cranmer’s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of\n",
    "every shore the round globe over.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a\n",
    "gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from\n",
    "the inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on\n",
    "ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your\n",
    "identity comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And\n",
    "perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled\n",
    "shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no\n",
    "more to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!\n",

    "CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "(_Enter Ahab: Then, all._)\n",
    "\n",
    "It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning\n",
    "shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the\n",
    "cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that\n",
    "hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in\n",
    "the garden.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old\n",
    "rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over\n",
    "dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did\n",
    "you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,\n",
    "you would see still stranger foot-prints—the foot-prints of his one\n",
    "unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his\n",
    "nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his\n",
    "thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the\n",
    "main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought\n",
    "turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely\n",
    "possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of\n",
    "every outer movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "“D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks\n",
    "the shell. ’Twill soon be out.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the\n",
    "deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the\n",
    "bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and\n",
    "with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody\n",
    "aft.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on\n",
    "ship-board except in some extraordinary case.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”\n",
    "\n",
    "When the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not\n",
    "wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike\n",
    "the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly\n",
    "glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,\n",
    "started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him\n",
    "resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched\n",
    "hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among\n",
    "the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have\n",
    "summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.\n",
    "But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:—\n",
    "\n",
    "“What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed\n",
    "voices.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the\n",
    "hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically\n",
    "thrown them.\n",
    "\n",
    "“And what do ye next, men?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Lower away, and after him!”\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "“A dead whale or a stove boat!”\n",
    "\n",
    "More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\n",
    "countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to\n",
    "gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they\n",
    "themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his\n",
    "pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,\n",
    "almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—\n",
    "\n",
    "“All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white\n",
    "whale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a\n",

    "round as though uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted\n",
    "and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole\n",
    "shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the\n",

    "been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed\n",
    "struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain\n",
    "Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took off\n",
    "thy leg?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, my\n",
    "hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that\n",
    "brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,” he shouted\n",
    "with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;\n",
    "“Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor\n",
    "pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then tossing both arms, with\n",
    "measureless imprecations he shouted out: “Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him\n",
    "round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom,\n",
    "and round perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye\n",
    "have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land,\n",
    "and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin\n",

    "“I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain\n",

    "barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain\n",
    "Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a\n",
    "little lower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and the\n",
    "accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by\n",
    "girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,\n",

    "rings most vast, but hollow.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee\n",
    "from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,\n",
    "Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Hark ye yet again—the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,\n",
    "are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act, the\n",
    "undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth\n",
    "the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man\n",
    "will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach\n",
    "outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is\n",
    "that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond.\n",
    "But ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous\n",
    "strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable\n",
    "thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the\n",
    "white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me\n",
    "of blasphemy, man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the\n",
    "sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of\n",
    "fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my\n",
    "master, man, is even that fair play. Who’s over me? Truth hath no\n",
    "confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends’ glarings is\n",
    "a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted\n",
    "thee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that\n",
    "thing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small\n",
    "indignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder\n",
    "Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living, breathing pictures painted by\n",
    "the sun. The Pagan leopards—the unrecking and unworshipping things,\n",
    "that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!\n",
    "The crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this\n",
    "matter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he\n",
    "snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one\n",
    "tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. ’Tis but to\n",
    "help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From\n",
    "this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely\n",
    "he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a\n",
    "whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!\n",
    "Speak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then, _that_ voices thee.\n",
    "(_Aside_) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in\n",
    "his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without\n",
    "rebellion.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab\n",
    "did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the\n",
    "hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor\n",
    "yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment\n",
    "their hearts sank in. For again Starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up\n",
    "with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the\n",
    "winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as\n",
    "before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?\n",
    "But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so\n",

    "“The measure! the measure!” cried Ahab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he\n",
    "ordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him\n",
    "near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three\n",
    "mates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship’s\n",
    "company formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant\n",
    "searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his,\n",
    "as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their\n",
    "leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but,\n",
    "alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the\n",
    "nearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short\n",

    "round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the\n",

    "with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some\n",
    "sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men,\n",
    "you will yet see that—Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner.\n",

    "suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from\n",
    "Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some\n",
    "nameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the\n",
    "same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own\n",
    "magnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained,\n",

    "eye of Starbuck fell downright.\n",
    "\n",
    "“In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did ye three but\n",
    "once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, _that_\n",
    "had perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped\n",
    "ye dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do\n",
    "appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three\n",

    "\n",
    "I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;\n",
    "my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more\n",
    "did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A\n",
    "wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud\n",
    "seemed mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous\n",
    "monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of\n",
    "violence and revenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,\n",
    "secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly\n",
    "frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of\n",
    "his existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen\n",
    "him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given\n",
    "battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of\n",
    "whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire\n",
    "watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest\n",
    "along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth\n",
    "or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any\n",
    "sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity\n",
    "of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances,\n",
    "direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole\n",
    "world-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings\n",
    "concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels\n",
    "reported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or\n",
    "such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity,\n",
    "which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had\n",
    "completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair\n",
    "presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other\n",
    "than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked\n",
    "by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and\n",
    "malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by\n",
    "accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps,\n",
    "for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,\n",
    "more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large,\n",
    "than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous\n",
    "encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly\n",
    "regarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance\n",
    "caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one\n",
    "of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any\n",
    "other whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue\n",
    "in these assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken\n",
    "limbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of\n",
    "fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and\n",
    "piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake\n",
    "the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White\n",
    "Whale had eventually come.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more\n",
    "horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do\n",
    "fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising\n",
    "terrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in\n",
    "maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors\n",
    "abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.\n",
    "And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery\n",
    "surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and\n",
    "fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only\n",
    "are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and\n",
    "superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they\n",
    "are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is\n",
    "appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its\n",
    "greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such\n",
    "remotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a\n",
    "thousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or\n",
    "aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and\n",
    "longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is\n",
    "wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many\n",
    "a mighty birth.\n",
    "\n",
    "No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over\n",
    "the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in\n",
    "the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and\n",
    "half-formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which\n",
    "eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything\n",
    "that visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally\n",
    "strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White\n",
    "Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his\n",
    "jaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.\n",
    "Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm\n",
    "Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\n",
    "leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are\n",
    "those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous\n",
    "enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would\n",
    "perhaps—either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or\n",
    "timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there\n",
    "are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not\n",
    "sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered\n",
    "the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is\n",
    "restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;\n",
    "seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish\n",
    "fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern\n",
    "whaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale\n",
    "anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows\n",
    "which stem him.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\n",
    "times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book\n",
    "naturalists—Olassen and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to\n",
    "be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be\n",
    "so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.\n",
    "Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost\n",
    "similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron\n",
    "himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks\n",
    "included) are “struck with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the\n",
    "precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with\n",
    "such violence as to cause instantaneous death.” And however the general\n",
    "experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in\n",
    "their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the\n",
    "superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their\n",
    "vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few\n",
    "of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days\n",
    "of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long\n",
    "practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring\n",
    "warfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be\n",
    "hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition\n",
    "as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be\n",
    "inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are\n",
    "some remarkable documents that may be consulted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\n",
    "were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,\n",
    "chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\n",
    "specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\n",
    "accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if\n",
    "offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked\n",
    "with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was\n",
    "the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had\n",
    "actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same\n",
    "instant of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\n",
    "altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as\n",
    "the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged,\n",
    "even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm\n",
    "Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to\n",
    "his pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious\n",
    "and contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning\n",
    "the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he\n",
    "transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant\n",
    "points.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and\n",
    "as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,\n",
    "that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose\n",
    "bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland\n",
    "seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has\n",
    "been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could\n",
    "not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been\n",
    "believed by some whalemen, that the Nor’ West Passage, so long a\n",
    "problem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the\n",
    "real living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old\n",
    "times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there\n",
    "was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the\n",
    "surface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain\n",
    "near Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy\n",
    "Land by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost\n",
    "fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\n",
    "knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\n",
    "escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen\n",
    "should go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not\n",
    "only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in\n",
    "time); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he\n",
    "would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to\n",
    "spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for\n",
    "again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied\n",
    "jet would once more be seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in\n",
    "the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike\n",
    "the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his\n",
    "uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,\n",
    "but, as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled\n",
    "forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent\n",
    "features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he\n",
    "revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the\n",
    "same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive\n",
    "appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by\n",
    "his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue\n",
    "sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\n",
    "gleamings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his\n",
    "deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural\n",
    "terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\n",
    "specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.\n",
    "More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than\n",
    "perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers,\n",
    "with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known\n",
    "to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their\n",
    "boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\n",
    "disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in\n",
    "the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale’s\n",
    "infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death\n",
    "that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an\n",
    "unintelligent agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of\n",
    "his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed\n",
    "boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the\n",
    "white curds of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating\n",
    "sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\n",
    "\n",
    "His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the\n",
    "eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had\n",
    "dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly\n",
    "seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the\n",
    "whale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping\n",
    "his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away\n",
    "Ahab’s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk,\n",
    "no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming\n",
    "malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that\n",
    "almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness\n",
    "against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness\n",
    "he at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but\n",
    "all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam\n",
    "before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious\n",
    "agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left\n",
    "living on with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity\n",
    "which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern\n",
    "Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of\n",
    "the east reverenced in their statue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and\n",
    "worship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the\n",
    "abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All\n",
    "that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;\n",
    "all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\n",
    "brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy\n",
    "Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby\n",
    "Dick. He piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the general\n",
    "rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if\n",
    "his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at\n",
    "the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the\n",
    "monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,\n",
    "corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he\n",
    "probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.\n",
    "Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long\n",
    "months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in\n",
    "one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian\n",
    "Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one\n",
    "another; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on\n",
    "the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania\n",
    "seized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals\n",
    "during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a\n",
    "leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was\n",
    "moreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to\n",
    "lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a\n",
    "strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when\n",
    "running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun’sails\n",
    "spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,\n",
    "the old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn\n",
    "swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and\n",
    "air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,\n",
    "and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the\n",
    "direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self,\n",
    "raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.\n",
    "When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some\n",
    "still subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\n",
    "contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\n",
    "narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his\n",
    "narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been\n",
    "left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural\n",
    "intellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living\n",
    "instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy\n",
    "stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its\n",
    "concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost\n",
    "his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold\n",
    "more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one\n",
    "reasonable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is much; yet Ahab’s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.\n",
    "But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding\n",
    "far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where\n",
    "we here stand—however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take your\n",
    "way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;\n",
    "where far beneath the fantastic towers of man’s upper earth, his root\n",
    "of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique\n",
    "buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken\n",
    "throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he\n",
    "patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of\n",
    "ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that\n",
    "proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young\n",
    "exiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old\n",
    "State-secret come.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means\n",
    "are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or\n",
    "change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long\n",
    "dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling\n",
    "was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.\n",
    "Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when\n",
    "with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him\n",
    "otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the\n",
    "terrible casualty which had overtaken him.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\n",
    "ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which\n",
    "always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the\n",
    "present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,\n",
    "that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on\n",
    "account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent\n",
    "isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons\n",
    "he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full\n",
    "of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and\n",
    "scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable\n",
    "idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart\n",
    "his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.\n",
    "Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,\n",
    "yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on\n",
    "his underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,\n",
    "that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in\n",
    "him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one\n",
    "only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one\n",
    "of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking\n",
    "in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have\n",
    "wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on\n",
    "profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the\n",
    "mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural\n",
    "revenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses\n",
    "a Job’s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made\n",
    "up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled\n",
    "also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in\n",
    "Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in\n",
    "Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so\n",
    "officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality\n",
    "to help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so\n",
    "aboundingly responded to the old man’s ire—by what evil magic their\n",
    "souls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the\n",
    "White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to\n",
    "be—what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious\n",
    "understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have\n",
    "seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,—all this to\n",
    "explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean\n",
    "miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by\n",
    "the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the\n",
    "irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand\n",
    "still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the\n",
    "place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see\n",
    "naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.\n",

    "CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he\n",
    "was to me, as yet remains unsaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which\n",
    "could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there\n",
    "was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,\n",
    "which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest;\n",
    "and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost\n",
    "despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of\n",
    "the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to\n",
    "explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I\n",
    "must, else all these chapters might be naught.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,\n",
    "as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,\n",
    "japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way\n",
    "recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric,\n",
    "grand old kings of Pegu placing the title “Lord of the White Elephants”\n",
    "above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the\n",
    "modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the\n",
    "royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a\n",
    "snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, Cæsarian, heir to\n",
    "overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue;\n",
    "and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself,\n",
    "giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and\n",
    "though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of\n",
    "gladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and\n",
    "though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is\n",
    "made the emblem of many touching, noble things—the innocence of brides,\n",
    "the benignity of age; though among the Red Men of America the giving of\n",
    "the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor; though in\n",
    "many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of\n",
    "the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn\n",
    "by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most\n",
    "august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness\n",
    "and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame\n",
    "being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies,\n",
    "Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and\n",
    "though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred\n",
    "White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that\n",
    "spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send\n",
    "to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and\n",
    "though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests\n",
    "derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,\n",
    "worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish\n",
    "faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of\n",
    "our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to\n",
    "the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white\n",
    "before the great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there\n",
    "white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with\n",
    "whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an\n",
    "elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more\n",
    "of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.\n",
    "\n",
    "This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when\n",
    "divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object\n",
    "terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.\n",
    "Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the\n",
    "tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the\n",
    "transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which\n",
    "imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific,\n",
    "to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged\n",
    "tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded\n",
    "bear or shark.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who\n",
    "would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the\n",
    "whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable\n",
    "hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,\n",
    "it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the\n",
    "irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the\n",
    "fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together\n",
    "two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us\n",
    "with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true;\n",
    "yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified\n",
    "terror.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that\n",
    "creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the\n",
    "same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly\n",
    "hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish\n",
    "mass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence\n",
    "_Requiem_ denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music.\n",
    "Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark,\n",
    "and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him _Requin_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual\n",
    "wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all\n",
    "imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God’s great,\n",
    "unflattering laureate, Nature.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged\n",
    "gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch\n",
    "below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the\n",
    "main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and\n",
    "with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its\n",
    "vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous\n",
    "flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered\n",
    "cries, as some king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its\n",
    "inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took\n",
    "hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white\n",
    "thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled\n",
    "waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of\n",
    "towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only\n",
    "hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and\n",
    "turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!\n",
    "never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious\n",
    "thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I\n",
    "learned that goney was some seaman’s name for albatross. So that by no\n",
    "possibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with\n",
    "those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon\n",
    "our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to\n",
    "be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a\n",
    "little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.\n",
    "\n",
    "I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird\n",
    "chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in\n",
    "this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey\n",
    "albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such\n",
    "emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will\n",
    "tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.\n",
    "At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern\n",
    "tally round its neck, with the ship’s time and place; and then letting\n",
    "it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was\n",
    "taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding,\n",
    "the invoking, and adoring cherubim!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the\n",
    "White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,\n",
    "large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a\n",
    "thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the\n",
    "elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those\n",
    "days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At\n",
    "their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which\n",
    "every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his\n",
    "mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more\n",
    "resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A\n",
    "most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western\n",
    "world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the\n",
    "glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,\n",
    "bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid\n",
    "his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly\n",
    "streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his\n",
    "circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White\n",
    "Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through\n",
    "his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to\n",
    "the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe.\n",
    "Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this\n",
    "noble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so\n",
    "clothed him with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it\n",
    "which, though commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain\n",
    "nameless terror.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that\n",
    "accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and\n",
    "Albatross.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks\n",
    "the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is\n",
    "that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he\n",
    "bears. The Albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive\n",
    "deformity—and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him\n",
    "more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be\n",
    "so?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not\n",
    "the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this\n",
    "crowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the\n",
    "gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White\n",
    "Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice\n",
    "omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of\n",
    "that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their\n",
    "faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the\n",
    "market-place!\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all\n",
    "mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It\n",
    "cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of\n",
    "the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering\n",
    "there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of\n",
    "consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And\n",
    "from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the\n",
    "shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail\n",
    "to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in\n",
    "a milk-white fog—Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that\n",
    "even the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on\n",
    "his pallid horse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious\n",
    "thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest\n",
    "idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.\n",
    "\n",
    "But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to\n",
    "account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by\n",
    "the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of\n",
    "whiteness—though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped\n",
    "of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,\n",
    "but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however\n",
    "modified;—can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us\n",
    "to the hidden cause we seek?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,\n",
    "and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And\n",
    "though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about\n",
    "to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were\n",
    "entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able\n",

    "First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if\n",

    "just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under\n",

    "whiteness that so stirred me?”\n",

    "Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the\n",
    "snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the\n",
    "mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast\n",
    "altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to\n",
    "lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the\n",
    "backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an\n",
    "unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig\n",
    "to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding\n",

    "\n",
    "Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that\n",
    "took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his\n",
    "purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the\n",
    "transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea\n",
    "charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating\n",
    "himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various\n",
    "lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady\n",
    "pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At\n",
    "intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein\n",
    "were set down the seasons and places in which, on various former\n",
    "voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his\n",
    "head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever\n",
    "threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till\n",
    "it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and\n",
    "courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing\n",
    "lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\n",
    "cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were\n",
    "brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and\n",
    "others were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before\n",
    "him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to\n",
    "the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,\n",
    "it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\n",
    "creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem\n",
    "to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby\n",
    "calculating the driftings of the sperm whale’s food; and, also, calling\n",
    "to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular\n",
    "latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to\n",
    "certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that\n",
    "ground in search of his prey.\n",
    "\n",
    "So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\n",
    "sperm whale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\n",
    "that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;\n",
    "were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\n",
    "collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to\n",
    "correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the\n",
    "flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to construct\n",
    "elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by\n",
    "  an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National\n",
    "  Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it\n",
    "  appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\n",
    "  portions of it are presented in the circular. “This chart divides the\n",
    "  ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of\n",
    "  longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve\n",
    "  columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which\n",
    "  districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have\n",
    "  been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to\n",
    "  show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been\n",
    "  seen.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the\n",
    "sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret\n",
    "intelligence from the Deity—mostly swim in _veins_, as they are called;\n",
    "continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating\n",
    "exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one\n",
    "tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the\n",
    "direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor’s parallel,\n",
    "and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own\n",
    "unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary _vein_ in which at these\n",
    "times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width\n",
    "(more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but\n",
    "never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship’s mast-heads, when\n",
    "circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at\n",
    "particular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating\n",
    "whales may with great confidence be looked for.\n",
    "\n",
    "And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\n",
    "feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing\n",
    "the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his\n",
    "art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be\n",
    "wholly without prospect of a meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\n",
    "delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,\n",
    "perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons\n",
    "for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the\n",
    "herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,\n",
    "say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were\n",
    "found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and\n",
    "unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In\n",
    "general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the\n",
    "solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that\n",
    "though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what\n",
    "is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on\n",
    "the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to\n",
    "visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she\n",
    "would infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding\n",
    "grounds, where he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed\n",
    "only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his\n",
    "places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of accomplishing\n",
    "his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to\n",
    "whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a\n",
    "particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities\n",
    "would become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every\n",
    "possibility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and\n",
    "place were conjoined in the one technical phrase—the\n",
    "Season-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years,\n",
    "Moby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters for\n",
    "awhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted\n",
    "interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of\n",
    "the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the\n",
    "waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot\n",
    "where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his\n",
    "vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering\n",
    "vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering\n",
    "hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one\n",
    "crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those\n",
    "hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\n",
    "unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the\n",
    "Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her\n",
    "commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\n",
    "then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\n",
    "Pacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next\n",
    "ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had,\n",
    "perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very\n",
    "complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and\n",
    "sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\n",
    "of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;\n",
    "if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote\n",
    "from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow\n",
    "off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any\n",
    "other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas,\n",
    "Nor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon,\n",
    "might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the\n",
    "Pequod’s circumnavigating wake.\n",
    "\n",
    "But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it\n",
    "not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one\n",
    "solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of\n",
    "individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti\n",
    "in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar\n",
    "snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be\n",
    "unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to\n",
    "himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he\n",
    "would throw himself back in reveries—tallied him, and shall he escape?\n",
    "His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear!\n",
    "And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a\n",
    "weariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air\n",
    "of the deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what\n",
    "trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one\n",
    "unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes\n",
    "with his own bloody nails in his palms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid\n",
    "dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through\n",
    "the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them\n",
    "round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing\n",
    "of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was\n",
    "sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up\n",
    "from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked\n",
    "flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap\n",
    "down among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild\n",
    "cry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would\n",
    "burst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on\n",
    "fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms\n",
    "of some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the\n",
    "plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the\n",
    "scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab\n",
    "that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to\n",
    "burst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living\n",
    "principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated\n",
    "from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its\n",
    "outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the\n",
    "scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it\n",
    "was no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless\n",
    "leagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s\n",
    "case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme\n",
    "purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced\n",
    "itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent\n",
    "being of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common\n",
    "vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the\n",
    "unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that\n",
    "glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room,\n",

    "So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,\n",
    "as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious\n",
    "particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in\n",
    "its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this\n",

    "more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,\n",
    "and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of\n",
    "the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity\n",
    "of the main points of this affair.\n",
    "\n",
    "I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be\n",
    "content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of\n",
    "items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from\n",
    "these citations, I take it—the conclusion aimed at will naturally\n",
    "follow of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after\n",
    "receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an\n",
    "interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the\n",
    "same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same\n",
    "private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where\n",
    "three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I\n",
    "think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted\n",
    "them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to\n",
    "Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far\n",
    "into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,\n",
    "often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with\n",
    "all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of\n",
    "unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been\n",
    "on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,\n",
    "brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.\n",
    "This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the\n",
    "other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this;\n",
    "that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second\n",
    "attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them,\n",
    "afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so\n",
    "fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the\n",
    "last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the\n",
    "whale’s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say\n",
    "three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three\n",
    "instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard\n",
    "of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there\n",
    "is no good ground to impeach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant\n",
    "the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable\n",
    "historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at\n",
    "distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became\n",
    "thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily\n",
    "peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar\n",
    "in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his\n",
    "peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly\n",
    "valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences\n",
    "of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about\n",
    "such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most\n",
    "fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their\n",
    "tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,\n",
    "without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some\n",
    "poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they\n",
    "make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they\n",
    "pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump\n",
    "for their presumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual\n",
    "celebrity—Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he\n",
    "famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,\n",
    "but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions\n",
    "of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Cæsar. Was it not\n",

    "vicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan,\n",
    "whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white\n",
    "cross against the sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale,\n",

    "times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were\n",

    "whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For\n",
    "this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full\n",
    "as much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of\n",
    "the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some\n",
    "hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the\n",
    "fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still\n",
    "worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.\n",
    "\n",
    "First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general\n",
    "perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid\n",
    "conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.\n",
    "One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters\n",
    "and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at\n",
    "home, however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you\n",
    "suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by\n",
    "the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to\n",
    "the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that\n",
    "that poor fellow’s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will\n",
    "read to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very\n",
    "irregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what\n",
    "might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I\n",
    "tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific,\n",
    "among many others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which\n",
    "had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that\n",
    "had each lost a boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical with your\n",
    "lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of\n",
    "man’s blood was spilled for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale\n",
    "is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that\n",
    "when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold\n",
    "enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my\n",
    "facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of\n",
    "being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues of\n",
    "Egypt.\n",
    "\n",
    "But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon\n",
    "testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm\n",
    "Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously\n",
    "malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy,\n",
    "and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale _has_ done it.\n",
    "\n",
    "First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,\n",
    "was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her\n",
    "boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of\n",
    "the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping\n",
    "from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the\n",
    "ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that\n",
    "in less than “ten minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a\n",
    "surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest\n",
    "exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being\n",
    "returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific\n",
    "in command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon\n",
    "unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly\n",
    "lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since.\n",
    "At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen\n",
    "Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy;\n",
    "I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his\n",
    "son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed\n",
    "to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which\n",
    "directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at\n",
    "a short interval between them, both of which, according to their\n",
    "direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made\n",
    "ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the\n",
    "shock; to effect which, the exact manœuvres which he made were\n",
    "necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated\n",
    "resentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just\n",
    "before entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as\n",
    "if fired with revenge for their sufferings.” Again: “At all events, the\n",
    "whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes,\n",
    "and producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided,\n",
    "calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which\n",
    "impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am\n",
    "correct in my opinion.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a\n",
    "black night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any\n",
    "hospitable shore. “The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the\n",
    "fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon\n",
    "hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful\n",
    "contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment’s thought; the\n",
    "dismal looking wreck, and _the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale_,\n",
    "wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “_the mysterious and mortal attack\n",
    "of the animal_.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807\n",
    "totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic\n",
    "particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,\n",
    "though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual\n",
    "allusions to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——, then\n",
    "commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be\n",
    "dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in\n",
    "the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,\n",
    "the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength\n",
    "ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily\n",
    "denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout\n",
    "sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very\n",
    "good; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set\n",
    "sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on\n",
    "the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments’\n",
    "confidential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the\n",
    "Commodore’s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made\n",
    "straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not\n",
    "superstitious, but I consider the Commodore’s interview with that whale\n",
    "as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a\n",
    "similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little circumstance\n",
    "in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you\n",
    "must know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern’s\n",
    "famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century.\n",
    "Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "“By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day\n",
    "we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was\n",
    "very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to\n",
    "keep on our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was\n",
    "not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up.\n",
    "An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship\n",
    "itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived\n",
    "by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full\n",
    "sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its\n",
    "striking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger,\n",
    "as this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three\n",
    "feet at least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell\n",
    "altogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck,\n",
    "concluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw\n",
    "the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain\n",
    "D’Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the\n",
    "vessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very\n",
    "happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the Captain D’Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\n",
    "question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\n",
    "adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\n",
    "Dorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I\n",
    "have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff.\n",
    "He substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large\n",
    "one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my\n",
    "uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,\n",
    "too, of honest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient\n",
    "Dampier’s old chums—I found a little matter set down so like that just\n",
    "quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a\n",
    "corroborative example, if such be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lionel, it seems, was on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls the\n",
    "modern Juan Fernandes. “In our way thither,” he says, “about four\n",
    "o’clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\n",
    "leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which\n",
    "put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where\n",
    "they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death.\n",
    "And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for\n",
    "granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was\n",
    "a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * *\n",
    "* * * The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their\n",
    "carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.\n",
    "Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his\n",
    "cabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and\n",
    "seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great\n",
    "earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief\n",
    "along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the\n",
    "darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all\n",
    "caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.\n",
    "\n",
    "I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to\n",
    "me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more\n",
    "than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing\n",
    "boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long\n",
    "withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship\n",
    "Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let\n",
    "me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a\n",
    "running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and\n",
    "secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a\n",
    "horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if\n",
    "the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,\n",
    "not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of\n",
    "destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent\n",
    "indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will\n",
    "frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for\n",
    "several consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more\n",
    "and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,\n",
    "by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous\n",
    "event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but\n",
    "that these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages;\n",
    "so that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon—Verily there is\n",
    "nothing new under the sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate\n",
    "of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and\n",
    "Belisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own\n",
    "times, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he\n",
    "has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating\n",
    "historian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting\n",
    "the matter presently to be mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\n",
    "of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\n",
    "in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed\n",
    "vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty\n",
    "years. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be\n",
    "gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species\n",
    "this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as\n",
    "well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly\n",
    "inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long\n",
    "time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the\n",
    "Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am\n",
    "certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the\n",
    "present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious\n",
    "resort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in\n",
    "modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the\n",
    "sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on\n",
    "the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the\n",
    "skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes\n",
    "through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,\n",
    "pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\n",
    "substance called _brit_ is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.\n",
    "But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\n",
    "whale—squid or cuttle-fish—lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\n",
    "large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\n",
    "found at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements\n",
    "together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\n",
    "according to all human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for\n",
    "half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all\n",
    "probability have been a sperm whale.\n",

    "\n",
    "Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his\n",
    "thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby\n",
    "Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that\n",
    "one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and\n",
    "long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, altogether\n",
    "to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if\n",
    "this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more\n",
    "influential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even\n",
    "considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the\n",
    "White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all\n",
    "sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he\n",
    "multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would\n",
    "prove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be\n",
    "indeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,\n",
    "though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling\n",
    "passion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in\n",
    "the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,\n",
    "for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was\n",
    "over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual\n",
    "man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual\n",
    "mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in\n",
    "a sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck’s body and Starbuck’s coerced\n",
    "will were Ahab’s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck’s brain;\n",
    "still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred\n",
    "his captain’s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself\n",
    "from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would\n",
    "elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck\n",
    "would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\n",
    "captain’s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial\n",
    "influences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle\n",
    "insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly\n",
    "manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing\n",
    "that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that\n",
    "strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the\n",
    "full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\n",
    "background (for few men’s courage is proof against protracted\n",
    "meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night\n",
    "watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of\n",
    "than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had\n",
    "hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are\n",
    "more or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer\n",
    "weather, and they inhale its fickleness—and when retained for any\n",
    "object remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and\n",
    "passion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary\n",
    "interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily\n",

    "mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.\n",
    "The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought\n",
    "Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the\n",
    "hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even\n",
    "breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for\n",
    "the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food\n",
    "for their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and\n",

    "thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without\n",
    "committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious\n",
    "perquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final\n",
    "and romantic object—that final and romantic object, too many would have\n",
    "turned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of\n",

    "same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would\n",
    "soon cashier Ahab.\n",

    "Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related\n",
    "to Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps\n",
    "somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the\n",
    "Pequod’s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he\n",
    "had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of\n",
    "usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew\n",
    "if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further\n",
    "obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From\n",
    "even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible\n",
    "consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must\n",
    "of course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection\n",
    "could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,\n",
    "backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute\n",
    "atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be\n",
    "subjected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be\n",
    "verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good\n",
    "degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod’s\n",
    "voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force\n",
    "himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general\n",
    "pursuit of his profession.\n",

    "Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three\n",

    "CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging\n",
    "about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.\n",
    "Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,\n",
    "for an additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet\n",
    "somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie\n",
    "lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own\n",
    "invisible self.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I\n",
    "kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the\n",
    "long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as\n",
    "Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword\n",
    "between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly\n",
    "and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess\n",
    "did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only\n",
    "broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as\n",
    "if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically\n",
    "weaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of\n",
    "the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging\n",
    "vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise\n",
    "interblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed\n",
    "necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle\n",
    "and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,\n",
    "Queequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof\n",
    "slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;\n",
    "and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding\n",
    "contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s\n",
    "sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and\n",
    "woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance, free\n",
    "will, and necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working\n",
    "together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its\n",
    "ultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending\n",
    "to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;\n",
    "and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of\n",
    "necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though\n",
    "thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the\n",
    "last featuring blow at events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so\n",
    "strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of\n",
    "free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds\n",
    "whence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees\n",
    "was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly\n",
    "forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden\n",
    "intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that\n",
    "very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of\n",
    "whalemen’s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those\n",
    "lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous\n",
    "cadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and\n",
    "eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some\n",
    "prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries\n",
    "announcing their coming.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Where-away?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantly all was commotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and\n",
    "reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from\n",
    "other tribes of his genus.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales\n",
    "disappeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact\n",
    "minute to Ahab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling\n",
    "before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to\n",
    "leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of\n",
    "our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale\n",
    "when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while\n",
    "concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in\n",
    "the opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his could not now be in\n",
    "action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by\n",
    "Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our\n",
    "vicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not\n",
    "appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the\n",
    "main-mast head. The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the\n",
    "line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the\n",
    "mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three\n",
    "samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager\n",
    "crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly\n",
    "poised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war’s men about\n",
    "to throw themselves on board an enemy’s ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took\n",
    "every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was\n",
    "surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side\n",
    "of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the\n",
    "tackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always\n",
    "been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the\n",
    "captain’s, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The\n",
    "figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white\n",
    "tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese\n",
    "jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black\n",
    "trowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness\n",
    "was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and\n",
    "coiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the\n",
    "companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion\n",
    "peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;—a race\n",
    "notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white\n",
    "mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents\n",
    "on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose\n",
    "to be elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "While yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these\n",
    "strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head,\n",
    "“All ready there, Fedallah?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ready,” was the half-hissed reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across the deck. “Lower away\n",
    "there, I say.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the\n",
    "men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with\n",
    "a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a\n",
    "dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the\n",
    "sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship’s side into the tossed\n",
    "boats below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship’s lee, when a fourth\n",
    "keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and\n",
    "showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the\n",
    "stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves\n",
    "widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their\n",
    "eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of\n",
    "the other boats obeyed not the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Captain Ahab?—” said Starbuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou,\n",
    "Flask, pull out more to leeward!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his\n",
    "great steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing his crew.\n",
    "“There!—there!—there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!—lay\n",
    "back!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh, I don’t mind ’em, sir,” said Archy; “I knew it all before now.\n",
    "Didn’t I hear ’em in the hold? And didn’t I tell Cabaco here of it?\n",
    "What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little\n",
    "ones,” drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom\n",
    "still showed signs of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your backbones,\n",
    "my boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They\n",
    "are only five more hands come to help us—never mind from where—the more\n",
    "the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone—devils are\n",
    "good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that’s the stroke for a\n",
    "thousand pounds; that’s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the\n",
    "gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men—all hearts alive!\n",
    "Easy, easy; don’t be in a hurry—don’t be in a hurry. Why don’t you snap\n",
    "your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so,\n",
    "then:—softly, softly! That’s it—that’s it! long and strong. Give way\n",
    "there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are\n",
    "all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull,\n",
    "can’t ye? pull, won’t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes\n",
    "don’t ye pull?—pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!\n",
    "Here!” whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; “every mother’s\n",
    "son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his teeth.\n",
    "That’s it—that’s it. Now ye do something; that looks like it, my\n",
    "steel-bits. Start her—start her, my silver-spoons! Start her,\n",
    "marling-spikes!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Stubb’s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had\n",
    "rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in\n",
    "inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this\n",
    "specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions\n",
    "with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief\n",
    "peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a\n",
    "tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so\n",
    "calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear\n",
    "such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling\n",
    "for the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy\n",
    "and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so\n",
    "broadly gaped—open-mouthed at times—that the mere sight of such a\n",
    "yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon\n",
    "the crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists,\n",
    "whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all\n",
    "inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely\n",
    "across Stubb’s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were\n",
    "pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye\n",
    "please!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Halloa!” returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he\n",
    "spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set\n",
    "like a flint from Stubb’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,\n",
    "boys!)” in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: “A sad\n",
    "business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,\n",
    "Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what\n",
    "will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.\n",
    "Stubb, and that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm’s the\n",
    "play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized Stubb, when the boats\n",
    "diverged, “as soon as I clapt eye on ’em, I thought so. Aye, and that’s\n",
    "what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long\n",
    "suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale’s at the bottom\n",
    "of it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be helped! All right! Give way, men!\n",
    "It ain’t the White Whale to-day! Give way!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant\n",
    "as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably\n",
    "awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship’s\n",
    "company; but Archy’s fancied discovery having some time previous got\n",
    "abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some\n",
    "small measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge\n",
    "of their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb’s confident way of\n",
    "accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from\n",
    "superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room\n",
    "for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in\n",
    "the matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the\n",
    "mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the\n",
    "dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the\n",
    "unaccountable Elijah.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the\n",
    "furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a\n",
    "circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger\n",
    "yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five\n",
    "trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which\n",
    "periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst\n",
    "boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen\n",
    "pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and\n",
    "displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the\n",
    "gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery\n",
    "horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a\n",
    "fencer’s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance\n",
    "any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar\n",
    "as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All\n",
    "at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained\n",
    "fixed, while the boat’s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat\n",
    "and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in\n",
    "the rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily\n",
    "down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the\n",
    "movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Every man look out along his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg,\n",
    "stand up!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage\n",
    "stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the\n",
    "spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme\n",
    "stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with\n",
    "the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing\n",
    "himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently\n",
    "eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not very far distant Flask’s boat was also lying breathlessly still;\n",
    "its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a\n",
    "stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above\n",
    "the level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the\n",
    "whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man’s hand,\n",
    "and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the\n",
    "mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little\n",
    "King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post\n",
    "was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead\n",
    "stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I can’t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to\n",
    "that.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,\n",
    "swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty\n",
    "shoulders for a pedestal.\n",

    "“Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you\n",
    "fifty feet taller.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the\n",
    "boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to\n",
    "Flask’s foot, and then putting Flask’s hand on his hearse-plumed head\n",
    "and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous\n",
    "fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was\n",
    "Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a\n",
    "breastband to lean against and steady himself by.\n",
    "\n",
    "At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous\n",
    "habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect\n",
    "posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously\n",
    "perverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily\n",
    "perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the\n",
    "sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more\n",
    "curious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy,\n",
    "unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the\n",
    "sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired\n",
    "Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider.\n",
    "Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now\n",
    "and then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby\n",
    "give to the negro’s lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity\n",
    "stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her\n",
    "tides and her seasons for that.\n",

    "where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed\n",

    "suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white\n",

    "were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\n",
    "atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\n",
    "water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other\n",
    "indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning\n",
    "couriers and detached flying outriders.\n",

    "All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled\n",

    "hills.\n",

    "“Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but\n",
    "intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance\n",
    "from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two\n",
    "visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much\n",
    "to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the\n",
    "silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his\n",
    "peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.\n",

    "from his head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up,\n",
    "flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and\n",
    "plunging in the boat’s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.\n",

    "watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the\n",
    "top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other\n",
    "side;—all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and\n",
    "the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the\n",

    "The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and\n",
    "more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows\n",
    "flung upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted\n",
    "everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.\n",
    "The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales\n",
    "running dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still\n",
    "rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through\n",
    "the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to\n",
    "escape being torn from the row-locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither\n",
    "ship nor boat to be seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Give way, men,” whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the\n",
    "sheet of his sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall\n",

    "Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted\n",
    "that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when\n",

    "Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril\n",
    "so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance\n",
    "of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent\n",
    "instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of\n",
    "fifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still\n",
    "booming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like\n",
    "the erected crests of enraged serpents.\n",
    "\n",
    "“That’s his hump. _There_, _there_, give it to him!” whispered\n",
    "Starbuck.\n",

    "A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of\n",
    "Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from\n",
    "astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail\n",
    "collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;\n",
    "something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole\n",
    "crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the\n",
    "white curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all\n",
    "blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round\n",
    "it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,\n",
    "tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea,\n",
    "the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing\n",
    "eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the\n",
    "bottom of the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;\n",
    "the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white\n",
    "fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal\n",
    "in these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar\n",
    "to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those\n",
    "boats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew\n",
    "darker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.\n",
    "The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were\n",
    "useless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.\n",
    "So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many\n",
    "failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then\n",
    "stretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the\n",
    "standard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up\n",
    "that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness. There,\n",
    "then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly\n",
    "holding up hope in the midst of despair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,\n",
    "we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over\n",
    "the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.\n",
    "Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.\n",
    "We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled\n",
    "by the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were\n",
    "dimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the\n",
    "sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us\n",
    "within a distance of not much more than its length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it\n",
    "tossed and gaped beneath the ship’s bows like a chip at the base of a\n",
    "cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no\n",
    "more till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were\n",
    "dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely\n",
    "landed on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut\n",
    "loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship\n",
    "had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon\n",
    "some token of our perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.\n",

    "imputed to Starbuck’s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a\n",
    "squall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for\n",

    "considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and\n",
    "extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then\n",

    "joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of\n",

    "crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.\n",
    "Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that\n",

    "he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it\n",
    "is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing\n",
    "the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was\n",

    "fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the\n",
    "carpenter’s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a\n",
    "little there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and\n",
    "curiosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this\n",
    "particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to\n",
    "the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his\n",

    "the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight\n",
    "nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a\n",
    "look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,\n",
    "though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a\n",
    "hundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what\n",
    "emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at\n",
    "such unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But\n",
    "when, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive\n",
    "nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence,\n",
    "his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet,\n",
    "every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit\n",
    "had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. “There she\n",
    "blows!” Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered\n",
    "more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was\n",
    "a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously\n",
    "exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a\n",
    "lowering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the\n",
    "t’gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The\n",
    "best man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head\n",
    "manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange,\n",
    "upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows\n",
    "of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air\n",
    "beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic\n",
    "influences were struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven, the\n",
    "other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched\n",
    "Ahab’s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two\n",
    "different things were warring. While his one live leg made lively\n",
    "echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a\n",
    "coffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship\n",
    "so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager\n",
    "glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every\n",
    "sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days\n",
    "after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it\n",
    "was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it\n",
    "disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after\n",
    "night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted\n",
    "into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be;\n",
    "disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and\n",
    "somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still\n",
    "further and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever\n",
    "alluring us on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance\n",
    "with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested\n",
    "the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that\n",
    "whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however\n",
    "far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by\n",
    "one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there\n",
    "reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as\n",
    "if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the\n",
    "monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest\n",
    "and most savage seas.\n",
    "\n",
    "These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a\n",
    "wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in\n",
    "which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a\n",
    "devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so\n",
    "wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful\n",
    "errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began\n",
    "howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas\n",
    "that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the\n",
    "blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of\n",
    "silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this\n",
    "desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more\n",
    "dismal than before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither\n",
    "before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And\n",
    "every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and\n",
    "spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,\n",
    "as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a\n",
    "thing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for\n",
    "their homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved\n",
    "the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great\n",
    "mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering\n",
    "it had bred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called\n",
    "of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had\n",
    "attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where\n",
    "guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed\n",
    "condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat\n",
    "that black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and\n",
    "unvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still\n",
    "beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be\n",
    "descried.\n",
    "\n",
    "During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for\n",
    "the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous\n",
    "deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever\n",
    "addressed his mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything\n",
    "above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but\n",
    "passively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become\n",
    "practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its\n",
    "accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for\n",
    "hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an\n",
    "occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very\n",
    "eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of\n",
    "the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,\n",
    "stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to\n",
    "guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a\n",
    "sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened\n",
    "belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by\n",
    "painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift\n",
    "madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness\n",
    "of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence\n",
    "the men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the\n",
    "blast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not\n",
    "seek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old\n",
    "man’s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the\n",
    "barometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his\n",
    "floor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from\n",
    "which he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the\n",
    "unremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of\n",
    "those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken\n",
    "of. His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though the body\n",
    "was erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were\n",
    "pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in\n",
    "the ceiling.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to\n",
    "the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself\n",
    "of the course of the ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this\n",
    "gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.\n",

    "CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.\n",
    "\n",
    "South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising\n",
    "ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross)\n",
    "by name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the\n",
    "fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro\n",
    "in the far ocean fisheries—a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.\n",
    "\n",
    "As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the\n",
    "skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral\n",
    "appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all\n",
    "her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred\n",
    "over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it\n",
    "was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They\n",
    "seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment\n",
    "that had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops\n",
    "nailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and\n",
    "though, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men\n",
    "in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped\n",
    "from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those\n",
    "forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not\n",
    "one word to our own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being\n",
    "heard from below.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”\n",
    "\n",
    "But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in\n",
    "the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his\n",
    "hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to\n",
    "make himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing\n",
    "the distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the\n",
    "Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the\n",
    "first mere mention of the White Whale’s name to another ship, Ahab for\n",
    "a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a\n",
    "boat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But\n",
    "taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet,\n",
    "and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer\n",
    "and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is the\n",
    "Pequod, bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters\n",
    "to the Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home,\n",
    "tell them to address them to ——”\n",
    "\n",
    "At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,\n",
    "in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,\n",
    "that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side,\n",
    "darted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves\n",
    "fore and aft with the stranger’s flanks. Though in the course of his\n",
    "continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar\n",
    "sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously\n",
    "carry meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Swim away from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.\n",
    "There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of\n",
    "deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced.\n",
    "But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in\n",
    "the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion\n",
    "voice,—“Up helm! Keep her off round the world!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;\n",
    "but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through\n",
    "numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that\n",
    "we left behind secure, were all the time before us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for\n",
    "ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange\n",
    "than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise\n",
    "in the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in\n",
    "tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims\n",

    "either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.\n",

    "CHAPTER 53. The Gam.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had\n",
    "spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this\n",
    "not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded\n",
    "her—judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions—if so it had\n",
    "been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer\n",
    "to the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not\n",
    "to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he\n",
    "could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But\n",
    "all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said\n",
    "here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other\n",
    "in foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the\n",
    "equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering\n",
    "each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of\n",
    "them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment\n",
    "to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and\n",
    "resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the\n",
    "illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling\n",
    "vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth—off lone\n",
    "Fanning’s Island, or the far away King’s Mills; how much more natural,\n",
    "I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only\n",
    "interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and\n",
    "sociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of\n",
    "course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose\n",
    "captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to\n",
    "each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to\n",
    "talk about.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on\n",
    "board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a\n",
    "date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and\n",
    "thumb-worn files. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound\n",
    "ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the\n",
    "cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost\n",
    "importance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning\n",
    "whaling vessels crossing each other’s track on the cruising-ground\n",
    "itself, even though they are equally long absent from home. For one of\n",
    "them may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and now\n",
    "far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of\n",
    "the ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling news,\n",
    "and have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all the\n",
    "sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar\n",
    "congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared\n",
    "privations and perils.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;\n",
    "that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case\n",
    "with Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number\n",
    "of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when\n",
    "they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them;\n",
    "for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not\n",
    "fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English\n",
    "whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the\n",
    "American whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his\n",
    "nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this\n",
    "superiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be\n",
    "hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill\n",
    "more whales than all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this\n",
    "is a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the\n",
    "Nantucketer does not take much to heart; probably, because he knows\n",
    "that he has a few foibles himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the\n",
    "whalers have most reason to be sociable—and they are so. Whereas, some\n",
    "merchant ships crossing each other’s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will\n",
    "oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,\n",
    "mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies\n",
    "in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism\n",
    "upon each other’s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at\n",
    "sea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and\n",
    "scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be\n",
    "much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As\n",
    "touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry,\n",
    "they run away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates,\n",
    "when they chance to cross each other’s cross-bones, the first hail\n",
    "is—“How many skulls?”—the same way that whalers hail—“How many\n",
    "barrels?” And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer\n",
    "apart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don’t like to\n",
    "see overmuch of each other’s villanous likenesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\n",
    "free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another\n",
    "whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a “_Gam_,” a thing so\n",
    "utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name\n",
    "even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,\n",
    "and repeat gamesome stuff about “spouters” and “blubber-boilers,” and\n",
    "such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and\n",
    "also all Pirates and Man-of-War’s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish\n",
    "such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it\n",
    "would be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should\n",
    "like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory\n",
    "about it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at\n",
    "the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion,\n",
    "he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I\n",
    "conclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman,\n",
    "in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is a _Gam?_ You might wear out your index-finger running up\n",
    "and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr.\n",
    "Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster’s ark does not\n",
    "hold it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years\n",
    "been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees.\n",
    "Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the\n",
    "Lexicon. With that view, let me learnedly define it.\n",

    "GAM. NOUN—_A social meeting of two_ (_or more_) _Whaleships, generally\n",
    "on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange\n",

    "board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other._\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten\n",
    "here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so\n",
    "has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the\n",
    "captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern\n",
    "sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often\n",
    "steers himself with a pretty little milliner’s tiller decorated with\n",
    "gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa\n",
    "of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if\n",
    "whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old\n",
    "aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never\n",
    "admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete\n",
    "boat’s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or\n",
    "harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the\n",
    "occasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to\n",
    "his visit all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that\n",
    "being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him\n",
    "from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to\n",
    "the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor\n",
    "is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting\n",
    "steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the\n",
    "after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus\n",
    "completely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself\n",
    "sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent\n",
    "pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of\n",
    "foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a\n",
    "spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,\n",
    "it would never do in plain sight of the world’s riveted eyes, it would\n",
    "never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying\n",
    "himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his\n",
    "hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he\n",
    "generally carries his hands in his trowsers’ pockets; but perhaps being\n",
    "generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.\n",
    "Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones\n",
    "too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment\n",

    "rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,\n",
    "was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days’ sail eastward\n",
    "from the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the\n",
    "northward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according\n",
    "to daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold\n",
    "than common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But\n",
    "the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good\n",
    "luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to\n",
    "quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous,\n",
    "though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low\n",
    "down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued\n",
    "her cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy\n",
    "intervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was\n",
    "the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that\n",
    "now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the\n",
    "nearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and\n",
    "repaired.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance\n",
    "favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the\n",
    "way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically\n",
    "relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the\n",
    "ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well\n",
    "nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous\n",
    "breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at\n",

    "gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as\n",
    "large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far\n",
    "Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet\n",
    "been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly\n",
    "connected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,\n",
    "those grand fresh-water seas of ours,—Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and\n",
    "Superior, and Michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many\n",
    "of the ocean’s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of\n",
    "races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic\n",
    "isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by\n",
    "two great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long\n",
    "maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East,\n",
    "dotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by\n",
    "batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they\n",
    "have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they\n",
    "yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash\n",
    "from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by\n",
    "ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried\n",

    "and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as\n",
    "direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks\n",
    "are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full\n",
    "many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen,\n",
    "though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean\n",
    "nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney,\n",
    "though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket\n",
    "beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long\n",
    "followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was\n",
    "he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods\n",
    "seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet\n",
    "was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this\n",
    "Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by\n",
    "inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human\n",
    "recognition which is the meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this\n",
    "Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he\n",
    "had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and\n",
    "Steelkilt—but, gentlemen, you shall hear.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her\n",
    "prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho’s leak seemed again\n",
    "increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps\n",
    "every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our\n",
    "Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their\n",
    "whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the\n",
    "officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the\n",
    "probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again\n",
    "remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.\n",
    "Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,\n",
    "gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their\n",
    "pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length;\n",
    "that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other\n",
    "reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is\n",
    "in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless\n",
    "latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found\n",
    "gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by\n",
    "several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the\n",
    "upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way\n",
    "expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a\n",
    "coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness\n",
    "touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or\n",
    "on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he\n",
    "betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the\n",
    "seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner\n",
    "in her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was\n",
    "on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they\n",
    "stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear\n",
    "water; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen—that bubbling from the\n",
    "pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at\n",
    "the lee scupper-holes.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional\n",
    "world of ours—watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command\n",
    "over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his\n",
    "superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he\n",
    "conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a\n",
    "chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern’s tower, and make\n",
    "a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,\n",
    "gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a\n",
    "head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled\n",
    "housings of your last viceroy’s snorting charger; and a brain, and a\n",
    "heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt\n",
    "Charlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne’s father. But Radney,\n",
    "the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.\n",
    "He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the\n",
    "rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with\n",
    "his gay banterings.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,\n",
    "one of ye, and let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I\n",
    "tell ye what, men, old Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best cut\n",
    "away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that\n",
    "sword-fish only began the job; he’s come back again with a gang of\n",
    "ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole\n",
    "posse of ’em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom;\n",
    "making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I’d tell him\n",
    "to jump overboard and scatter ’em. They’re playing the devil with his\n",
    "estate, I can tell him. But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad, and a beauty\n",
    "too. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in\n",
    "looking-glasses. I wonder if he’d give a poor devil like me the model\n",
    "of his nose.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Damn your eyes! what’s that pump stopping for?’ roared Radney,\n",
    "pretending not to have heard the sailors’ talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Aye, aye, sir,’ said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. ‘Lively, boys,\n",
    "lively, now!’ And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;\n",
    "the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping\n",
    "of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life’s\n",
    "utmost energies.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went\n",
    "forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face\n",
    "fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his\n",
    "brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney\n",
    "to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know\n",
    "not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate\n",
    "commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a\n",
    "shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a\n",
    "pig to run at large.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household\n",
    "work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\n",
    "evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\n",
    "foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of\n",
    "sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom\n",
    "would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all\n",
    "vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,\n",
    "if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the\n",
    "Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps;\n",
    "and being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been\n",
    "regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should\n",
    "have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly\n",
    "nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all\n",
    "these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair\n",
    "stood between the two men.\n",
    "\n",
    "“But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as\n",
    "plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat\n",
    "in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\n",
    "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\n",
    "fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat\n",
    "still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate’s\n",
    "malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him\n",
    "and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\n",
    "instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness\n",
    "to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being—a\n",
    "repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when\n",
    "aggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over\n",
    "Steelkilt.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\n",
    "exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping\n",
    "the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then,\n",
    "without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the\n",
    "customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done\n",
    "little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a\n",
    "most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his\n",
    "command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an\n",
    "uplifted cooper’s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near\n",
    "by.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for\n",
    "all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt\n",
    "could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still\n",
    "smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained\n",
    "doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the\n",
    "hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do\n",
    "his bidding.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\n",
    "followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\n",
    "his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\n",
    "not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\n",
    "his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\n",
    "was to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the\n",
    "windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him\n",
    "that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\n",
    "Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to\n",
    "yourself.’ But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where\n",
    "the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of\n",
    "his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.\n",
    "Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye\n",
    "with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his\n",
    "right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his\n",
    "persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would\n",
    "murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter\n",
    "by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant\n",
    "the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch\n",
    "spouting blood like a whale.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\n",
    "leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their\n",
    "mastheads. They were both Canallers.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Canallers!’ cried Don Pedro. ‘We have seen many whale-ships in our\n",
    "harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are\n",
    "they?’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.\n",
    "You must have heard of it.’\n",

    "\n",
    "“‘Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha’s very fine; and ere\n",
    "proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such\n",
    "information may throw side-light upon my story.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire\n",
    "breadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and\n",
    "most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and\n",
    "affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room\n",
    "and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman\n",
    "arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or\n",
    "broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk\n",
    "counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires\n",
    "stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly\n",
    "corrupt and often lawless life. There’s your true Ashantee, gentlemen;\n",
    "there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;\n",
    "under the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.\n",
    "For by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan\n",
    "freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so\n",
    "sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.\n",

    "us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by\n",
    "no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for\n",
    "distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look\n",
    "surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast—“Corrupt as Lima.”\n",
    "It but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than\n",

    "“Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would\n",
    "make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is\n",
    "he. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery\n",
    "Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked\n",
    "Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore,\n",
    "all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller\n",
    "so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his\n",
    "grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages\n",
    "through which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not\n",
    "unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received\n",
    "good turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would\n",
    "fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming\n",
    "qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm\n",
    "to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In\n",
    "sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is\n",
    "emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so\n",
    "many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of\n",
    "mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling\n",
    "captains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter,\n",
    "that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its\n",
    "line, the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole\n",
    "transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and\n",
    "recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.\n",

    "had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and\n",
    "the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down\n",
    "the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the\n",
    "uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.\n",
    "Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted\n",

    "out of that, ye cut-throats!’\n",
    "\n",
    "“Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,\n",
    "defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to\n",
    "understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt’s) death would be the signal\n",
    "for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart\n",
    "lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but\n",
    "still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?’ demanded their\n",
    "ringleader.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you want to\n",
    "sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!’ and he\n",
    "once more raised a pistol.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Sink the ship?’ cried Steelkilt. ‘Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us\n",
    "turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What\n",
    "say ye, men?’ turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their\n",
    "response.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye\n",
    "on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:—‘It’s not our\n",
    "fault; we didn’t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was\n",
    "boy’s business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to\n",
    "prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his\n",
    "cursed jaw; ain’t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there,\n",
    "men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to\n",
    "yourself; say the word; don’t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to\n",
    "turn to; treat us decently, and we’re your men; but we won’t be\n",
    "flogged.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Look ye, now,’ cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,\n",
    "‘there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for\n",
    "the cruise, d’ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our\n",
    "discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don’t want a row; it’s\n",
    "not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we\n",
    "won’t be flogged.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Turn to!’ roared the Captain.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:—‘I tell you what\n",
    "it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby\n",
    "rascal, we won’t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till\n",
    "you say the word about not flogging us, we don’t do a hand’s turn.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I’ll keep ye there till\n",
    "ye’re sick of it. Down ye go.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Shall we?’ cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against\n",
    "it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down\n",
    "into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.\n",
    "\n",
    "“As the Lakeman’s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain\n",
    "and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide\n",
    "of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called\n",
    "for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the\n",
    "companionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered\n",
    "something down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them—ten\n",
    "in number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had\n",
    "remained neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "“All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and\n",
    "aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at\n",
    "which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after\n",
    "breaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed\n",
    "in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the\n",
    "pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary\n",
    "night dismally resounded through the ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "“At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,\n",
    "summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was\n",
    "then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were\n",
    "tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it,\n",
    "the Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three\n",
    "days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling,\n",
    "and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered;\n",
    "and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were\n",
    "ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet,\n",
    "united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained\n",
    "them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain\n",
    "reiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a\n",
    "terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he\n",
    "belonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up\n",
    "into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain\n",
    "them. Only three were left.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Better turn to, now?’ said the Captain with a heartless jeer.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Shut us up again, will ye!’ cried Steelkilt.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Oh certainly,’ said the Captain, and the key clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of\n",
    "seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had\n",
    "last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as\n",
    "black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to\n",
    "the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst\n",
    "out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with\n",
    "their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a\n",
    "handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if\n",
    "by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For\n",
    "himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not.\n",
    "That was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met\n",
    "with no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were\n",
    "ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a\n",
    "surrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first\n",
    "man on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this\n",
    "their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself;\n",
    "particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other,\n",
    "in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder\n",
    "would but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play\n",
    "of these miscreants must come out.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own\n",
    "separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece\n",
    "of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be\n",
    "the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and\n",
    "thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might\n",
    "merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead\n",
    "them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of\n",
    "villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their\n",
    "leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in\n",
    "three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with\n",
    "cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he\n",
    "and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a\n",
    "few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still\n",
    "struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious\n",
    "allies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been\n",
    "fully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along\n",
    "the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the\n",
    "mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till\n",
    "morning. ‘Damn ye,’ cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,\n",
    "‘the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!’\n",
    "\n",
    "“At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had\n",
    "rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the\n",
    "former that he had a good mind to flog them all round—thought, upon the\n",
    "whole, he would do so—he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the\n",
    "present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with\n",
    "a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’ turning to the three men in the\n",
    "rigging—‘for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;’ and, seizing\n",
    "a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two\n",
    "traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads\n",
    "sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried, at last; ‘but there is still\n",
    "rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn’t give up. Take\n",
    "that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his\n",
    "cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a\n",
    "sort of hiss, ‘What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I\n",
    "murder you!’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—and the Captain drew off with\n",
    "the rope to strike.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Best not,’ hissed the Lakeman.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘But I must,’—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain;\n",
    "who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck\n",
    "rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope,\n",
    "said, ‘I won’t do it—let him go—cut him down: d’ye hear?’\n",
    "\n",
    "“But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale\n",
    "man, with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever\n",
    "since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the\n",
    "tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the\n",
    "whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly\n",
    "speak; but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do\n",
    "what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced\n",
    "to his pinioned foe.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘You are a coward!’ hissed the Lakeman.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘So I am, but take that.’ The mate was in the very act of striking,\n",
    "when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing\n",
    "no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt’s threat, whatever that\n",
    "might have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were\n",
    "turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps\n",
    "clanged as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor\n",
    "was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,\n",
    "besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.\n",
    "Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own\n",
    "instance they were put down in the ship’s run for salvation. Still, no\n",
    "sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,\n",
    "that mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to maintain\n",
    "the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the\n",
    "ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the\n",
    "speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely,\n",
    "not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,\n",
    "spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still\n",
    "maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower\n",
    "for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the\n",
    "cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his\n",
    "berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the\n",
    "vital jaw of the whale.\n",
    "\n",
    "“But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\n",
    "passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till\n",
    "all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the\n",
    "man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney\n",
    "the chief mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more\n",
    "than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he\n",
    "insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the\n",
    "head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other\n",
    "circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "“During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\n",
    "bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of\n",
    "the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In\n",
    "this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a\n",
    "considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between\n",
    "this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his\n",
    "next trick at the helm would come round at two o’clock, in the morning\n",
    "of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his\n",
    "leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully\n",
    "in his watches below.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘What do you think? what does it look like?’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’s an odd one, seems to me.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Yes, rather oddish,’ said the Lakeman, holding it at arm’s length\n",
    "before him; ‘but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven’t enough\n",
    "twine,—have you any?’\n",
    "\n",
    "“But there was none in the forecastle.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’ and he rose to go aft.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘You don’t mean to go a begging to _him!_’ said a sailor.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Why not? Do you think he won’t do me a turn, when it’s to help\n",
    "himself in the end, shipmate?’ and going to the mate, he looked at him\n",
    "quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given\n",
    "him—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an\n",
    "iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the\n",
    "Lakeman’s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock\n",
    "for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent\n",
    "helm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready\n",
    "dug to the seaman’s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the\n",
    "fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and\n",
    "stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "“But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody\n",
    "deed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the\n",
    "avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in\n",
    "to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have\n",
    "done.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second\n",
    "day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe\n",
    "man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, ‘There\n",
    "she rolls! there she rolls!’ Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Moby Dick!’ cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do\n",
    "whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but\n",
    "that would be too long a story.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘How? how?’ cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more\n",
    "into the air, Sirs.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘The chicha! the chicha!’ cried Don Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend looks\n",
    "faint;—fill up his empty glass!’\n",
    "\n",
    "“No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now, gentlemen, so\n",
    "suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the\n",
    "ship—forgetful of the compact among the crew—in the excitement of the\n",
    "moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted\n",
    "his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been\n",
    "plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy.\n",
    "‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’ was the cry from captain, mates, and\n",
    "harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to\n",
    "capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed\n",
    "askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,\n",
    "that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a\n",
    "living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality\n",
    "pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out\n",
    "before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of\n",
    "the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,\n",
    "while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or\n",
    "slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats\n",
    "were lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none howled more fiercely\n",
    "with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a\n",
    "stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney\n",
    "sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.\n",
    "And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost back.\n",
    "Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding\n",
    "foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat\n",
    "struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the\n",
    "standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back,\n",
    "the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was\n",
    "tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck\n",
    "out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that\n",
    "veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But\n",
    "the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer\n",
    "between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again,\n",
    "and went down.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had\n",
    "slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly\n",
    "looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,\n",
    "downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He\n",
    "cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose\n",
    "again, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the\n",
    "teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the\n",
    "whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "“In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary\n",
    "place—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the\n",
    "Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted\n",
    "among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double\n",
    "war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called\n",
    "upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving\n",
    "down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over\n",
    "their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both\n",
    "by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,\n",
    "that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a\n",
    "weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so\n",
    "heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the\n",
    "ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon\n",
    "from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the\n",
    "Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with\n",
    "him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight\n",
    "before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a\n",
    "reinforcement to his crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "“On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which\n",
    "seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from\n",
    "it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of\n",
    "Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The\n",
    "captain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked\n",
    "war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the\n",
    "pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and\n",
    "foam.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘What do you want of me?’ cried the captain.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?’ demanded Steelkilt;\n",
    "‘no lies.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that he\n",
    "leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,\n",
    "stood face to face with the captain.\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As\n",
    "soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder\n",
    "island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike\n",
    "me!’\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping\n",
    "into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the\n",
    "roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due\n",
    "time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck\n",

    "CHAPTER 55. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.\n",
    "\n",
    "I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\n",
    "something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the\n",
    "eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored\n",
    "alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.\n",
    "It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious\n",
    "imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day\n",
    "confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the\n",
    "world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all\n",
    "wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will\n",
    "be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For\n",
    "ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble\n",
    "panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,\n",
    "medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of\n",
    "chain-armor like Saladin’s, and a helmeted head like St. George’s; ever\n",
    "since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not\n",
    "only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific\n",
    "presentations of him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\n",
    "to be the whale’s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\n",
    "Elephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless\n",
    "sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits,\n",
    "every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of\n",
    "them actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our\n",
    "noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The\n",
    "Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,\n",
    "depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly\n",
    "known as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and\n",
    "half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small\n",
    "section of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an\n",
    "anaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale’s majestic flukes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\n",
    "painter’s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the\n",
    "antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido’s picture of Perseus rescuing\n",
    "Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model\n",
    "of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the\n",
    "same scene in his own “Perseus Descending,” make out one whit better.\n",
    "The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the\n",
    "surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on\n",
    "its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are\n",
    "rolling, might be taken for the Traitors’ Gate leading from the Thames\n",
    "by water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old\n",
    "Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale, as depicted in the prints of old\n",
    "Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for\n",
    "the book-binder’s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a\n",
    "descending anchor—as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of\n",
    "many books both old and new—that is a very picturesque but purely\n",
    "fabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on\n",
    "antique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless\n",
    "call this book-binder’s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so\n",
    "intended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an\n",
    "old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\n",
    "Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\n",
    "comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\n",
    "species of the Leviathan.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\n",
    "will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all\n",
    "manner of spouts, jets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and\n",
    "Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the\n",
    "title-page of the original edition of the “Advancement of Learning” you\n",
    "will find some curious whales.\n",
    "\n",
    "But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those\n",
    "pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,\n",
    "by those who know. In old Harris’s collection of voyages there are some\n",
    "plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,\n",
    "entitled “A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the\n",
    "Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.” In one of those plates the\n",
    "whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among\n",
    "ice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another\n",
    "plate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with\n",
    "perpendicular flukes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\n",
    "Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round\n",
    "Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\n",
    "Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.” In this book is an outline purporting to\n",
    "be a “Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from\n",
    "one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.”\n",
    "I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the\n",
    "benefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say\n",
    "that it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale,\n",
    "to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a\n",
    "bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not\n",
    "give us Jonah looking out of that eye!\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the\n",
    "benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of\n",
    "mistake. Look at that popular work “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” In\n",
    "the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged\n",
    "“whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this\n",
    "unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the\n",
    "narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this\n",
    "nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon\n",
    "any intelligent public of schoolboys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great\n",
    "naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\n",
    "several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these\n",
    "are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland\n",
    "whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long\n",
    "experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its\n",
    "counterpart in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\n",
    "reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\n",
    "Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he\n",
    "gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that\n",
    "picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary\n",
    "retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s Sperm Whale is\n",
    "not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of\n",
    "a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that\n",
    "picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor\n",
    "in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that\n",
    "is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the\n",
    "pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the sign-painters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the\n",
    "shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally\n",
    "Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;\n",
    "breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of\n",
    "mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\n",
    "paint.\n",
    "\n",
    "But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\n",
    "surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have\n",
    "been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a\n",
    "drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent\n",
    "the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.\n",
    "Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living\n",
    "Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The\n",
    "living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen\n",
    "at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out\n",
    "of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element\n",
    "it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily\n",
    "into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.\n",
    "And, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour\n",
    "between a young sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan;\n",
    "yet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a\n",
    "ship’s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying\n",
    "shape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not\n",
    "catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\n",
    "whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at\n",
    "all. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\n",
    "that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though\n",
    "Jeremy Bentham’s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of\n",
    "one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed\n",
    "utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other leading personal\n",
    "characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any\n",
    "leviathan’s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the\n",
    "mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully\n",
    "invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so\n",
    "roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the\n",
    "head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is\n",
    "also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which\n",
    "almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the\n",
    "thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring,\n",
    "and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy\n",
    "covering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. “However\n",
    "recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one\n",
    "day, “he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.”\n",
    "\n",
    "For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs\n",
    "conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world\n",
    "which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the\n",
    "mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very\n",
    "considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding\n",
    "out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in\n",
    "which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by\n",
    "going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of\n",
    "being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you\n",
    "had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this\n",
    "Leviathan.\n",

    "CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True\n",
    "Pictures of Whaling Scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly\n",
    "tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them\n",
    "which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,\n",
    "especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass\n",
    "that matter by.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;\n",
    "Colnett’s, Huggins’s, Frederick Cuvier’s, and Beale’s. In the previous\n",
    "chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins’s is far\n",
    "better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale’s is the best. All\n",
    "Beale’s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in\n",
    "the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second\n",
    "chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no\n",
    "doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is\n",
    "admirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the\n",
    "Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour;\n",
    "but they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they\n",
    "are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has\n",
    "but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency,\n",
    "because it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you\n",
    "can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by\n",
    "his living hunters.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details\n",
    "not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be\n",
    "anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and\n",
    "taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent\n",
    "attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble\n",
    "Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath\n",
    "the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the\n",
    "air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of\n",
    "the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the\n",
    "monster’s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single\n",
    "incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the\n",
    "incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if\n",
    "from a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and\n",
    "true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden\n",
    "poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the\n",
    "swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions\n",
    "of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing\n",
    "down upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical\n",
    "details of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I\n",
    "could not draw so good a one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\n",
    "the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\n",
    "black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\n",
    "Patagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\n",
    "that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\n",
    "must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are\n",
    "pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and\n",
    "maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\n",
    "back. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through\n",
    "the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and\n",
    "causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh\n",
    "the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all\n",
    "raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the\n",
    "glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the\n",
    "powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered\n",
    "fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole\n",
    "inserted into his spout-hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he\n",
    "was either practically conversant with his subject, or else\n",
    "marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the\n",
    "lads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe,\n",
    "and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing\n",
    "commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the\n",
    "beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great\n",
    "battles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern\n",
    "Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a\n",
    "charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that\n",
    "gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of\n",
    "things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings\n",
    "they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England’s\n",
    "experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the\n",
    "Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only\n",
    "finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the\n",
    "whale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale\n",
    "draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical\n",
    "outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so\n",
    "far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to\n",
    "sketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned\n",
    "Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland\n",
    "whale, and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and\n",
    "porpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks,\n",
    "chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a\n",
    "Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six\n",
    "fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement\n",
    "to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so\n",
    "important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured\n",
    "for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of\n",
    "the Peace.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other\n",
    "French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself\n",
    "“H. Durand.” One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present\n",
    "purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet\n",
    "noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored,\n",
    "inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened\n",
    "sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background,\n",
    "both drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine,\n",
    "when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen\n",
    "under one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving\n",
    "is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in\n",
    "the very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside;\n",
    "the vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to\n",
    "a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity,\n",
    "is about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and\n",
    "lances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in\n",
    "its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands\n",
    "half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the\n",
    "smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke\n",
    "over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up\n",
    "with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the\n",
    "excited seamen.\n",

    "our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening\n",
    "for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose,\n",
    "and silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?\n",
    "thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once\n",

    "swiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with\n",
    "oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot\n",
    "where it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the\n",
    "moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous\n",
    "phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A\n",
    "vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing\n",
    "cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms\n",
    "radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of\n",
    "anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.\n",
    "No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of\n",
    "either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an\n",
    "unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still\n",

    "of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature\n",
    "and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm\n",
    "whale his only food. For though other species of whales find their food\n",
    "above water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the\n",
    "spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the\n",
    "surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what,\n",
    "precisely, that food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will\n",
    "disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some\n",
    "of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They\n",

    "CHAPTER 60. The Line.\n",
    "\n",
    "With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as\n",
    "for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,\n",
    "I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly\n",
    "vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary\n",
    "ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable\n",
    "to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to\n",
    "the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary\n",
    "quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which\n",
    "it must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in\n",
    "general by no means adds to the rope’s durability or strength, however\n",
    "much it may give it compactness and gloss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost\n",
    "entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not\n",
    "so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and\n",
    "I will add (since there is an æsthetics in all things), is much more\n",
    "handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark\n",
    "fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian\n",
    "to behold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first\n",
    "sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment\n",
    "its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and\n",
    "twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal\n",
    "to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures\n",
    "something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is\n",
    "spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still\n",
    "though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely\n",
    "bedded “sheaves,” or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any\n",
    "hollow but the “heart,” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of\n",
    "the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in\n",
    "running out, infallibly take somebody’s arm, leg, or entire body off,\n",
    "the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some\n",
    "harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,\n",
    "carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a\n",
    "block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all\n",
    "possible wrinkles and twists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\n",
    "being continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in\n",
    "this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into\n",
    "the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub,\n",
    "nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a\n",
    "rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in\n",
    "thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which\n",
    "will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a\n",
    "concentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the\n",
    "American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a\n",
    "prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an\n",
    "eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the\n",
    "tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.\n",
    "This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:\n",
    "In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a\n",
    "neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to\n",
    "threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the\n",
    "harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug\n",
    "of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first\n",
    "boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This\n",
    "arrangement is indispensable for common safety’s sake; for were the\n",
    "lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the\n",
    "whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking\n",
    "minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed\n",
    "boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of\n",
    "the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\n",
    "taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is\n",
    "again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise\n",
    "upon the loom or handle of every man’s oar, so that it jogs against his\n",
    "wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately\n",
    "sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the\n",
    "extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size\n",
    "of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it\n",
    "hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the\n",
    "boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being\n",
    "coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale\n",
    "still a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp—the\n",
    "rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to\n",
    "that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too\n",
    "tedious to detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,\n",
    "twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the\n",
    "oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid\n",
    "eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest\n",
    "snakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal\n",
    "woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,\n",
    "and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any\n",
    "unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible\n",
    "contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus\n",
    "circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones\n",
    "to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit—strange thing! what\n",
    "cannot habit accomplish?—Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,\n",

    "repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of\n",
    "this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.\n",
    "For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is\n",
    "like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a\n",
    "steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and\n",
    "wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in\n",
    "the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle,\n",
    "and you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest\n",
    "warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and\n",
    "simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a\n",
    "Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could\n",
    "never pierce you out.\n",

    "Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and\n",

    "for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and\n",
    "contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal\n",
    "powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the\n",
    "line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought\n",
    "into actual play—this is a thing which carries more of true terror than\n",
    "any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men\n",
    "live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their\n",
    "necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,\n",
    "that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.\n",
    "And if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would\n",

    "sleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean\n",

    "in what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in\n",

    "long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the\n",
    "seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that\n",
    "at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every\n",
    "swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering\n",
    "helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the\n",
    "wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.\n",

    "Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my\n",

    "the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian\n",
    "hue, glistening in the sun’s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating\n",
    "in the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his\n",

    "a warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck\n",
    "by some enchanter’s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all\n",
    "at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from\n",
    "all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from\n",

    "as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed,\n",
    "Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak\n",
    "but in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the\n",
    "boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of\n",
    "the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase,\n",
    "the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,\n",

    "“There go flukes!” was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by\n",
    "Stubb’s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite\n",
    "was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the\n",
    "whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker’s boat, and\n",
    "much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the\n",
    "honor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length\n",
    "become aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore\n",
    "no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.\n",

    "Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy,\n",

    "\n",
    "*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the\n",
    "entire interior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists. Though\n",
    "apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about\n",
    "him. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does\n",
    "so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the\n",
    "upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water\n",
    "formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he\n",
    "thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish\n",
    "galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.\n",

    "“Start her, start her, my men! Don’t hurry yourselves; take plenty of\n",

    "\n",
    "“Ka-la! Koo-loo!” howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a\n",

    "cut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still\n",
    "encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from\n",
    "his mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the\n",
    "welcome cry was heard—“Stand up, Tashtego!—give it to him!” The harpoon\n",
    "was hurled. “Stern all!” The oarsmen backed water; the same moment\n",
    "something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was\n",
    "the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two\n",
    "additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its\n",
    "increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and\n",
    "mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round\n",
    "and round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it\n",
    "blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb’s hands, from\n",
    "which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at\n",
    "these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy’s\n",
    "sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time\n",
    "striving to wrest it out of your clutch.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Wet the line! wet the line!” cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him\n",
    "seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into\n",
    "it.* More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.\n",
    "The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.\n",
    "Stubb and Tashtego here changed places—stem for stern—a staggering\n",
    "business truly in that rocking commotion.\n",

    "*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be\n",
    "stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the\n",
    "running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or\n",
    "bailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most\n",
    "convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part\n",
    "of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you\n",
    "would have thought the craft had two keels—one cleaving the water, the\n",
    "other the air—as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at\n",
    "once. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy\n",
    "in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a\n",
    "little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic\n",
    "gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main\n",
    "clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall\n",
    "form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order\n",
    "to bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics\n",
    "seemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale\n",
    "somewhat slackened his flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Haul in—haul in!” cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round\n",
    "towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while\n",
    "yet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb,\n",
    "firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart\n",
    "into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately\n",
    "sterning out of the way of the whale’s horrible wallow, and then\n",
    "ranging up for another fling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down\n",
    "a hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which\n",
    "bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun\n",
    "playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection\n",
    "into every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men.\n",
    "And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot\n",
    "from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the\n",
    "mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his\n",
    "crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again\n",
    "and again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and\n",
    "again sent it into the whale.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Pull up—pull up!” he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale\n",
    "relaxed in his wrath. “Pull up!—close to!” and the boat ranged along\n",
    "the fish’s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned\n",
    "his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully\n",
    "churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold\n",
    "watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of\n",
    "breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was\n",
    "the innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting\n",
    "from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his “flurry,” the\n",
    "monster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in\n",
    "impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft,\n",
    "instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from\n",
    "that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into\n",
    "view; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting\n",
    "his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last,\n",
    "gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees\n",
    "of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran\n",
    "dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!\n",
    "\n",
    "“He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his mouth,\n",
    "Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood\n",
    "thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.\n",

    "CHAPTER 62. The Dart.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes\n",
    "off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary\n",
    "steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost\n",
    "oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong,\n",
    "nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what\n",
    "is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the\n",
    "distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting\n",
    "the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the\n",
    "uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman\n",
    "activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated\n",
    "loud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the\n",
    "top of one’s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half\n",
    "started—what that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I\n",
    "cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same\n",
    "time. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the\n",
    "fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting\n",
    "cry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He now has to drop and secure his\n",
    "oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the\n",
    "crotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it\n",
    "somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen\n",
    "in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are\n",
    "successful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed\n",
    "and disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their\n",
    "blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are\n",
    "absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship\n",
    "owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that\n",
    "makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can\n",
    "you expect to find it there when most wanted!\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,\n",
    "that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer\n",
    "likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of\n",
    "themselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the\n",
    "headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper\n",
    "station in the bows of the boat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both\n",
    "foolish and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from\n",
    "first to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no\n",
    "rowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances\n",
    "obvious to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a\n",
    "slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various\n",
    "whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast\n",
    "majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so\n",
    "much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the\n",
    "harpooneer that has caused them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this\n",

    "\n",
    "Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in\n",
    "productive subjects, grow the chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.\n",
    "It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length,\n",
    "which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the\n",
    "bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of\n",
    "the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the\n",
    "prow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who\n",
    "snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his\n",
    "rifle from the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in\n",
    "the crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.\n",
    "\n",
    "But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with\n",
    "the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one\n",
    "instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the\n",
    "coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It\n",
    "is a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to\n",
    "the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon\n",
    "receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer,\n",
    "however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into\n",
    "him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the\n",
    "line, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events,\n",
    "be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else\n",
    "the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the\n",
    "water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line\n",

    "prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended\n",
    "with the saddest and most fatal casualties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown\n",

    "Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is\n",

    "\n",
    "Stubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a\n",
    "calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow\n",
    "business of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen\n",
    "men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\n",
    "fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse\n",
    "in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long\n",
    "intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of\n",
    "the mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever\n",
    "they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will\n",
    "draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this\n",
    "grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead\n",
    "in bulk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod’s\n",
    "main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab\n",
    "dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly\n",
    "eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for\n",
    "securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,\n",
    "went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until\n",
    "morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had\n",
    "evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the\n",
    "creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or\n",
    "despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body\n",
    "reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand\n",
    "other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot\n",
    "advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought\n",
    "from the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all hands were preparing to\n",
    "cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the\n",
    "deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking\n",
    "links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by\n",
    "the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies\n",
    "with its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen through the darkness\n",
    "of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two—ship\n",
    "and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one\n",

    "is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is\n",
    "relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its\n",
    "flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;\n",
    "so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to\n",
    "put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a\n",
    "small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,\n",
    "and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.\n",
    "By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side\n",
    "of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily\n",
    "made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last\n",
    "locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of\n",
    "junction with its broad flukes or lobes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known\n",
    "on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an\n",
    "unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was\n",
    "he in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned\n",
    "to him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping\n",
    "cause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely\n",
    "manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of\n",
    "the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut\n",
    "me one from his small!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general\n",
    "thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray\n",
    "the current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds\n",
    "of the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers\n",
    "who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale\n",
    "designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two\n",
    "lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper\n",
    "at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb\n",
    "the only banqueter on whale’s flesh that night. Mingling their\n",
    "mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks,\n",
    "swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.\n",
    "The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp\n",
    "slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the\n",
    "sleepers’ hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as\n",
    "before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and\n",
    "turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of\n",
    "the whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the\n",
    "shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable\n",
    "surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains\n",
    "a part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave\n",
    "on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in\n",
    "countersinking for a screw.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks\n",
    "will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs\n",
    "round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every\n",
    "killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant\n",
    "butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other’s\n",
    "live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,\n",
    "also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away\n",
    "under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the\n",
    "whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing,\n",
    "that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties;\n",
    "and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships\n",
    "crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy\n",
    "in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be\n",
    "decently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be\n",
    "set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do\n",
    "most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no\n",
    "conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless\n",
    "numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm\n",
    "whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never seen\n",
    "that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of\n",
    "devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was\n",

    "his own epicurean lips.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Cook, cook!—where’s that old Fleece?” he cried at length, widening his\n",
    "legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;\n",

    "with his lance; “cook, you cook!—sail this way, cook!”\n",
    "\n",

    "something the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well\n",
    "scoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came\n",
    "shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which,\n",
    "after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops; this old\n",
    "Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of command, came\n",
    "to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb’s sideboard; when, with\n",
    "both hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he\n",
    "bowed his arched back still further over, at the same time sideways\n",
    "inclining his head, so as to bring his best ear into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Cook,” said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his\n",
    "mouth, “don’t you think this steak is rather overdone? You’ve been\n",
    "beating this steak too much, cook; it’s too tender. Don’t I always say\n",
    "that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks\n",
    "now over the side, don’t you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a\n",
    "shindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to ’em; tell ’em they are\n",
    "welcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must\n",
    "keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and\n",
    "deliver my message. Here, take this lantern,” snatching one from his\n",
    "sideboard; “now then, go and preach to ’em!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck\n",
    "to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over\n",
    "the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other\n",
    "hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in\n",
    "a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly\n",
    "crawling behind, overheard all that was said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Fellow-critters: I’se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam\n",
    "noise dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin’ ob de lip! Massa Stubb say\n",
    "dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but by Gor! you\n",
    "must stop dat dam racket!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Cook,” here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden slap\n",
    "on the shoulder,—“Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn’t swear that way\n",
    "when you’re preaching. That’s no way to convert sinners, cook!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,” sullenly turning to go.\n",

    "“No, cook; go on, go on.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:”—\n",
    "\n",
    "“Right!” exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, “coax ’em to it; try that,” and\n",
    "Fleece continued.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,\n",

    "\n",
    "“Cook,” cried Stubb, collaring him, “I won’t have that swearing. Talk\n",
    "to ’em gentlemanly.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Once more the sermon proceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don’t blame ye so much for; dat\n",
    "is natur, and can’t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is\n",
    "de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why\n",

    "bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can’t get into de\n",
    "scrouge to help demselves.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well done, old Fleece!” cried Stubb, “that’s Christianity; go on.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“No use goin’ on; de dam willains will keep a scougin’ and slappin’\n",
    "each oder, Massa Stubb; dey don’t hear one word; no use a-preachin’ to\n",

    "“Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,\n",
    "Fleece, and I’ll away to my supper.”\n",

    "Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his\n",
    "shrill voice, and cried—\n",
    "\n",
    "“Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill\n",
    "your dam’ bellies ’till dey bust—and den die.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now, cook,” said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; “stand\n",
    "just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular\n",
    "attention.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“All dention,” said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the\n",
    "desired position.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well,” said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; “I shall now go\n",
    "back to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are you,\n",
    "cook?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What dat do wid de ’teak,” said the old black, testily.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Silence! How old are you, cook?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“’Bout ninety, dey say,” he gloomily muttered.\n",
    "\n",
    "“And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,\n",
    "and don’t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?” rapidly bolting another\n",
    "mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the\n",
    "question. “Where were you born, cook?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“’Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin’ ober de Roanoke.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Born in a ferry-boat! That’s queer, too. But I want to know what\n",
    "country you were born in, cook!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Didn’t I say de Roanoke country?” he cried sharply.\n",
    "\n",
    "“No, you didn’t, cook; but I’ll tell you what I’m coming to, cook. You\n",
    "must go home and be born over again; you don’t know how to cook a\n",
    "whale-steak yet.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,” he growled, angrily, turning\n",
    "round to depart.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Come back, cook;—here, hand me those tongs;—now take that bit of steak\n",
    "there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be? Take\n",
    "it, I say”—holding the tongs towards him—“take it, and taste it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro\n",
    "muttered, “Best cooked ’teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Cook,” said Stubb, squaring himself once more; “do you belong to the\n",
    "church?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Passed one once in Cape-Down,” said the old man sullenly.\n",
    "\n",
    "“And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,\n",
    "where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as\n",
    "his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here,\n",
    "and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?” said Stubb.\n",
    "“Where do you expect to go to, cook?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Go to bed berry soon,” he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It’s an awful question.\n",
    "Now what’s your answer?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“When dis old brack man dies,” said the negro slowly, changing his\n",
    "whole air and demeanor, “he hisself won’t go nowhere; but some bressed\n",
    "angel will come and fetch him.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch\n",
    "him where?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Up dere,” said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and\n",
    "keeping it there very solemnly.\n",
    "\n",
    "“So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when\n",
    "you are dead? But don’t you know the higher you climb, the colder it\n",
    "gets? Main-top, eh?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Didn’t say dat t’all,” said Fleece, again in the sulks.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You said up there, didn’t you? and now look yourself, and see where\n",
    "your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by\n",
    "crawling through the lubber’s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don’t\n",
    "get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It’s a\n",
    "ticklish business, but must be done, or else it’s no go. But none of us\n",
    "are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye\n",
    "hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t’other a’top of your heart,\n",
    "when I’m giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?—that’s\n",
    "your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!—that’s it—now you have it. Hold it there\n",
    "now, and pay attention.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“All ’dention,” said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,\n",
    "vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at\n",
    "one and the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,\n",
    "that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,\n",
    "don’t you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for\n",
    "my private table here, the capstan, I’ll tell you what to do so as not\n",
    "to spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live\n",
    "coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d’ye hear? And now\n",
    "to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by\n",
    "to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends\n",
    "of the flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may go.”\n",
    "\n",

    "“Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.\n",

    "go.—Avast heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast—don’t forget.”\n",

    "That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,\n",
    "like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so\n",
    "outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and\n",
    "philosophy of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\n",
    "Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large\n",
    "prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook of the\n",
    "court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be\n",
    "eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of\n",
    "whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The\n",
    "meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being\n",
    "well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.\n",
    "The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great\n",
    "porpoise grant from the crown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\n",
    "hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\n",
    "when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\n",
    "long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men\n",
    "like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are\n",
    "not so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare\n",
    "old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous\n",
    "doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly\n",
    "juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who\n",
    "long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel—that\n",
    "these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of\n",
    "whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among\n",
    "the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called “fritters”; which, indeed,\n",
    "they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something\n",
    "like old Amsterdam housewives’ dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.\n",
    "They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can\n",
    "hardly keep his hands off.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\n",
    "exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be\n",
    "delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the\n",
    "buffalo’s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid\n",
    "pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that\n",
    "is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the\n",
    "third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for\n",
    "butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into\n",
    "some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches\n",
    "of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their\n",
    "ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many\n",
    "a good supper have I thus made.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine\n",
    "dish. The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two\n",
    "plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large\n",
    "puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most\n",
    "delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves’ head, which is\n",
    "quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young\n",
    "bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves’ brains, by\n",
    "and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to\n",
    "tell a calf’s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires\n",
    "uncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with\n",
    "an intelligent looking calf’s head before him, is somehow one of the\n",
    "saddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at\n",
    "him, with an “Et tu Brute!” expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively\n",
    "unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with\n",
    "abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration\n",
    "before mentioned: _i.e._ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing\n",
    "of the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man\n",
    "that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was\n",
    "hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would\n",
    "have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the\n",
    "meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds\n",
    "staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight\n",

    "thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting\n",
    "him in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very\n",
    "soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the\n",
    "common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a’lee; and then send\n",
    "every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation\n",
    "that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and\n",
    "two for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck\n",
    "to see that all goes well.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will\n",
    "not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather\n",
    "round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a\n",
    "stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In\n",
    "most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so\n",
    "largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably\n",
    "diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a\n",
    "procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to\n",
    "tickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the\n",
    "present case with the Pequod’s sharks; though, to be sure, any man\n",
    "unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,\n",
    "would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and\n",
    "those sharks the maggots in it.\n",

    "Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was\n",
    "concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came\n",

    "immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering\n",
    "three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid\n",
    "sea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an\n",
    "incessant murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep\n",
    "into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy\n",
    "confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not\n",
    "always hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the\n",
    "incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at\n",
    "each other’s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and\n",
    "bit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again\n",
    "by the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was\n",
    "this all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these\n",
    "creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in\n",
    "their very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual\n",
    "life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,\n",
    "one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg’s hand off, when he tried\n",
    "to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;\n",
    "is about the bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general shape,\n",
    "corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its\n",
    "sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than\n",
    "the lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when\n",

    "CHAPTER 67. Cutting In.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio\n",
    "professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was\n",
    "turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would\n",
    "have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous\n",
    "things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and\n",
    "which no single man can possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was\n",
    "swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the\n",
    "strongest point anywhere above a ship’s deck. The end of the\n",
    "hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted\n",
    "to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over\n",
    "the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one\n",
    "hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the\n",
    "side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,\n",
    "began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just\n",
    "above the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad,\n",
    "semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the\n",
    "main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving\n",
    "in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship\n",
    "careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads\n",
    "of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her\n",
    "frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the\n",
    "whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a\n",
    "helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap\n",
    "is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from\n",
    "the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it\n",
    "the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as\n",
    "the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,\n",
    "so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes\n",
    "stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the\n",
    "windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the\n",
    "water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the\n",
    "line called the “scarf,” simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck\n",
    "and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and\n",
    "indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher\n",
    "and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the\n",
    "windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious\n",
    "blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and\n",
    "every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else\n",
    "it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon\n",
    "called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices\n",
    "out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into\n",
    "this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then\n",
    "hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for\n",
    "what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands\n",
    "to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a\n",
    "few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in\n",
    "twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper\n",
    "strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for\n",
    "lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one\n",
    "tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other\n",
    "is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the\n",
    "main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the\n",
    "blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep\n",
    "coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of\n",
    "plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting\n",
    "and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the\n",

    "CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin\n",
    "of the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced\n",
    "whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion\n",
    "remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you\n",
    "know what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence\n",
    "of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and\n",
    "ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any\n",
    "creature’s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet\n",
    "in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;\n",
    "because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the\n",
    "whale’s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer\n",
    "of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?\n",
    "True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with\n",
    "your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat\n",
    "resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as\n",
    "flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it\n",
    "not only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I\n",
    "have several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books.\n",
    "It is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed\n",
    "page, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a\n",
    "magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales\n",
    "through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving at\n",
    "here is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I\n",
    "admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be\n",
    "regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to\n",
    "speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of\n",
    "the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a\n",
    "new-born child. But no more of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,\n",
    "as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one\n",
    "hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity,\n",
    "or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three\n",
    "fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence\n",
    "be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose\n",
    "mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten\n",
    "barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three\n",
    "quarters of the stuff of the whale’s skin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among\n",
    "the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over\n",
    "obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in\n",
    "thick array, something like those in the finest Italian line\n",
    "engravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the\n",
    "isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as\n",
    "if they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some\n",
    "instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a\n",
    "veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations.\n",
    "These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers\n",
    "on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to\n",
    "use in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the\n",
    "hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck\n",
    "with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the\n",
    "famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi.\n",
    "Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains\n",
    "undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another\n",
    "thing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm\n",
    "Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially\n",
    "his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by\n",
    "reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random\n",
    "aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast,\n",
    "which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact\n",
    "with vast floating icebergs—I should say, that those rocks must not a\n",
    "little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me\n",
    "that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact\n",
    "with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,\n",
    "full-grown bulls of the species.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the\n",
    "whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long\n",
    "pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very\n",
    "happy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber\n",
    "as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho\n",
    "slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of\n",
    "this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep\n",
    "himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.\n",
    "What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy\n",
    "seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other\n",
    "fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but\n",
    "these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very\n",
    "bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the\n",
    "lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn\n",
    "fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his\n",
    "blood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then—except after\n",
    "explanation—that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as\n",
    "indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at\n",
    "home, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when\n",
    "seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,\n",
    "perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is\n",
    "found glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been\n",
    "proved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than\n",
    "that of a Borneo negro in summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong\n",
    "individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare\n",
    "virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself\n",
    "after the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too,\n",
    "live in this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep\n",
    "thy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter’s, and\n",
    "like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of\n",
    "thine own.\n",

    "proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and\n",
    "shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the\n",
    "Pequod could not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what\n",
    "response would be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships\n",
    "of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which\n",
    "signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective\n",
    "vessels attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale\n",
    "commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at\n",
    "considerable distances and with no small facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pequod’s signal was at last responded to by the stranger’s setting\n",
    "her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket.\n",
    "Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod’s lee,\n",
    "and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was\n",
    "being rigged by Starbuck’s order to accommodate the visiting captain,\n",
    "the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat’s stern in token\n",
    "of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the\n",
    "Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her\n",
    "captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod’s company. For, though\n",
    "himself and boat’s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was\n",
    "half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and\n",
    "flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine\n",
    "of the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with\n",
    "the Pequod.\n",

    "But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an\n",

    "blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times\n",
    "by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed\n",
    "some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper\n",

    "Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam’s boat, was a man of a singular\n",

    "man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant\n",
    "yellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut\n",
    "tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on\n",

    "exclaimed—“That’s he! that’s he!—the long-togged scaramouch the\n",
    "Town-Ho’s company told us of!” Stubb here alluded to a strange story\n",
    "told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time\n",
    "previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account\n",
    "and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in\n",
    "question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the\n",
    "Jeroboam. His story was this:\n",
    "\n",
    "He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna\n",
    "Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret\n",
    "meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a\n",
    "trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he\n",
    "carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing\n",
    "gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange,\n",
    "apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket,\n",
    "where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,\n",
    "common-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate\n",
    "for the Jeroboam’s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway\n",
    "upon the ship’s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in\n",
    "a freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded\n",
    "the captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he\n",
    "set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and\n",
    "vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which\n",
    "he declared these things;—the dark, daring play of his sleepless,\n",
    "excited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real\n",
    "delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of\n",
    "the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they\n",
    "were afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical\n",
    "use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he\n",
    "pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but\n",
    "apprised that that individual’s intention was to land him in the first\n",
    "convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and\n",
    "vials—devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in\n",
    "case this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his\n",
    "disciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the\n",
    "captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of\n",
    "them would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor\n",
    "would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he\n",
    "would; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of\n",
    "the ship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared\n",
    "little or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had\n",
    "broken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the\n",
    "plague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be\n",
    "stayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor\n",
    "devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to\n",
    "his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.\n",
    "Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.\n",
    "Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the\n",
    "measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless\n",

    "horrible tail!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I tell thee again, Gabriel, that—” But again the boat tore ahead as if\n",
    "dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a\n",
    "succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional\n",
    "caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the\n",
    "hoisted sperm whale’s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was\n",
    "seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel\n",
    "nature seemed to warrant.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\n",
    "concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from\n",
    "Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed\n",
    "leagued with him.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking\n",
    "a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of\n",
    "Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this\n",
    "intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the\n",
    "White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering\n",
    "insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the\n",
    "Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some\n",
    "year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the\n",
    "mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him;\n",
    "and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\n",
    "opportunity, despite all the archangel’s denunciations and\n",
    "forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.\n",
    "With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\n",
    "perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron\n",
    "fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was\n",
    "tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of\n",
    "speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while\n",
    "Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat’s bow, and with all the\n",
    "reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the\n",
    "whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a\n",
    "broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion,\n",
    "temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next\n",
    "instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily\n",
    "into the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea\n",
    "at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was\n",
    "harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman’s head; but the mate for ever sank.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\n",
    "Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\n",
    "Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\n",
    "oftener the boat’s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the\n",
    "headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But\n",
    "strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,\n",
    "when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is\n",
    "discernible; the man being stark dead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly\n",
    "descried from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! the vial!”\n",
    "Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of\n",
    "the whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added\n",
    "influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had\n",
    "specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general\n",
    "prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one\n",
    "of many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror\n",
    "to the ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,\n",
    "that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he\n",
    "intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which\n",
    "Ahab answered—“Aye.” Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to\n",
    "his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with\n",
    "downward pointed finger—“Think, think of the blasphemer—dead, and down\n",
    "there!—beware of the blasphemer’s end!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, “Captain, I have just\n",
    "bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy\n",
    "officers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various\n",
    "ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,\n",
    "depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.\n",
    "Thus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only received\n",
    "after attaining an age of two or three years or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely\n",
    "tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in\n",
    "consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a\n",
    "letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but\n",
    "a dim scrawl;—what’s this?” As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a\n",
    "long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to\n",
    "insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without\n",
    "its coming any closer to the ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a\n",
    "woman’s pinny hand,—the man’s wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—Mr. Harry Macey,\n",
    "Ship Jeroboam;—why it’s Macey, and he’s dead!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but let\n",
    "me have it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Nay, keep it thyself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going\n",
    "that way.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to\n",
    "receive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck’s hands, he\n",
    "caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the\n",
    "boat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing;\n",
    "the boat drifted a little towards the ship’s stern; so that, as if by\n",
    "magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel’s eager hand. He\n",
    "clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the\n",
    "letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab’s\n",
    "feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their\n",
    "oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the\n",
    "Pequod.\n",
    "\n",
    "As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket\n",

    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,\n",
    "there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands\n",
    "are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no\n",
    "staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has\n",
    "to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the\n",
    "description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was\n",
    "mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the\n",
    "blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the\n",
    "spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that\n",
    "same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my\n",
    "particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to\n",
    "descend upon the monster’s back for the special purpose referred to.\n",
    "But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall\n",
    "remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is\n",
    "concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,\n",
    "excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten\n",
    "feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,\n",
    "half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like\n",
    "a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured\n",
    "in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at\n",
    "least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better\n",
    "chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar\n",
    "in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to\n",
    "attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead\n",
    "whale’s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by\n",
    "a long cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg\n",
    "down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a\n",
    "monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his\n",
    "waist.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\n",
    "proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both\n",
    "ends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow\n",
    "leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,\n",
    "were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both\n",
    "usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should\n",
    "drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature\n",
    "united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I\n",
    "any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond\n",
    "entailed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,\n",
    "that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to\n",
    "perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock\n",
    "company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that\n",
    "another’s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited\n",
    "disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of\n",
    "interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have\n",
    "so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked\n",
    "him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten\n",
    "to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of\n",
    "mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in\n",
    "most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a\n",
    "plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your\n",
    "apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True,\n",
    "you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these\n",
    "and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s\n",
    "monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I\n",
    "came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do\n",
    "what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod\n",
    "that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This\n",
    "improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man\n",
    "than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest\n",
    "possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his\n",
    "monkey-rope holder.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the\n",
    "whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant\n",
    "rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy\n",
    "he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the\n",
    "night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before\n",
    "pent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures\n",
    "swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.\n",
    "\n",
    "And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them\n",
    "aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it\n",
    "not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise\n",
    "miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a\n",
    "ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to\n",
    "them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then\n",
    "jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what\n",
    "seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another\n",
    "protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and\n",
    "Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen\n",
    "whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could\n",
    "reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and\n",
    "benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg’s best happiness, I admit; but\n",
    "in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that\n",
    "both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled\n",
    "water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a\n",
    "leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping\n",
    "there with that great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed\n",
    "to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in\n",
    "and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters\n",
    "it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men\n",
    "in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those\n",
    "sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks\n",
    "and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.\n",
    "\n",
    "But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now,\n",
    "as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last\n",
    "climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily\n",
    "trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,\n",
    "consolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye\n",
    "gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.\n",
    "“Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then\n",
    "standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the\n",
    "astonished steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have\n",
    "the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of\n",
    "ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to\n",
    "kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is\n",
    "ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what\n",
    "the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor\n",
    "Queequeg here.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this\n",
    "business,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just\n",
    "come from forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it,\n",
    "if you please.” Then watching the mate’s countenance, he added, “The\n",
    "steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to\n",
    "Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an\n",
    "apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by\n",
    "which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we’ll teach you to drug a\n",
    "harpooneer; none of your apothecary’s medicine here; you want to poison\n",
    "us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder\n",
    "us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the\n",
    "ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits,\n",
    "but only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to\n",
    "the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr.\n",
    "Starbuck. It is the captain’s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a\n",
    "whale.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don’t hit him again, but—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of\n",
    "that sort; and this fellow’s a weazel. What were you about saying,\n",
    "sir?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”\n",
    "\n",
    "When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a\n",
    "sort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and\n",
    "was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity’s gift, and that\n",
    "was freely given to the waves.\n",

    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk\n",
    "over Him.\n",
    "\n",
    "It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’s\n",
    "prodigious head hanging to the Pequod’s side. But we must let it\n",
    "continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to\n",
    "it. For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for\n",
    "the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually\n",
    "drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,\n",
    "gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the\n",
    "Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking\n",
    "anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of\n",
    "those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to\n",
    "cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near\n",
    "the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had\n",
    "been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the\n",
    "announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day,\n",
    "if opportunity offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two\n",
    "boats, Stubb’s and Flask’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further\n",
    "and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at\n",
    "the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of\n",
    "tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or\n",
    "both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in\n",
    "plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the\n",
    "towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first\n",
    "it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a\n",
    "maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from\n",
    "view, as if diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the\n",
    "ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being\n",
    "brought with a deadly dash against the vessel’s side. But having plenty\n",
    "of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they\n",
    "paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their\n",
    "might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle\n",
    "was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened\n",
    "line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the\n",
    "contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few\n",
    "feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did\n",
    "gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning\n",
    "along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,\n",
    "suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so\n",
    "flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken\n",
    "glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once\n",
    "more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,\n",
    "and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship\n",
    "towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete\n",
    "circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close\n",
    "flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance;\n",
    "and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the\n",
    "multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale’s body,\n",
    "rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every\n",
    "new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains\n",
    "that poured from the smitten rock.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he\n",
    "turned upon his back a corpse.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,\n",
    "and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some\n",
    "conversation ensued between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said\n",
    "Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so\n",
    "ignoble a leviathan.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat’s bow,\n",
    "“did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale’s\n",
    "head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right\n",
    "Whale’s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can\n",
    "never afterwards capsize?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so,\n",
    "and he seems to know all about ships’ charms. But I sometimes think\n",
    "he’ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don’t half like that chap,\n",
    "Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved\n",
    "into a snake’s head, Stubb?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a\n",
    "dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look\n",
    "down there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both\n",
    "hands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in\n",
    "disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been\n",
    "stowed away on board ship? He’s the devil, I say. The reason why you\n",
    "don’t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries\n",

    "the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away\n",
    "his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then\n",
    "he’ll surrender Moby Dick.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked\n",
    "one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old\n",
    "flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and\n",
    "gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he\n",
    "was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching\n",
    "his hoofs, up and says, ‘I want John.’ ‘What for?’ says the old\n",
    "governor. ‘What business is that of yours,’ says the devil, getting\n",
    "mad,—‘I want to use him.’ ‘Take him,’ says the governor—and by the\n",
    "Lord, Flask, if the devil didn’t give John the Asiatic cholera before\n",
    "he got through with him, I’ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look\n",
    "sharp—ain’t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’s get\n",
    "the whale alongside.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask,\n",

    "along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that\n",

    "again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he\n",
    "lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn\n",
    "the devil, Flask; so you suppose I’m afraid of the devil? Who’s afraid\n",
    "of him, except the old governor who daresn’t catch him and put him in\n",
    "double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping\n",

    "to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious\n",
    "going on, I’ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look\n",
    "here, Beelzebub, you don’t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord\n",
    "I’ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,\n",
    "and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come\n",
    "short off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess when he\n",
    "finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he’ll sneak off without the\n",
    "poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,\n",
    "where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for\n",
    "securing him.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Didn’t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you’ll soon see this right\n",
    "whale’s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti’s.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In good time, Flask’s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply\n",
    "leaned over towards the sperm whale’s head, now, by the counterpoise of\n",
    "both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may\n",
    "well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke’s head, you go\n",
    "over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant’s and you come\n",
    "back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep\n",
    "trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard,\n",
    "and then you will float light and right.\n",
    "\n",
    "In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the\n",
    "ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the\n",
    "case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut\n",
    "off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed\n",
    "and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to\n",
    "what is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present\n",
    "case, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern;\n",
    "and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair\n",
    "of overburdening panniers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale’s head, and ever\n",
    "and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own\n",
    "hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his\n",
    "shadow; while, if the Parsee’s shadow was there at all it seemed only\n",
    "to blend with, and lengthen Ahab’s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish\n",
    "speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing\n",
    "things.\n",

    "CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us\n",
    "join them, and lay together our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\n",
    "Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales\n",
    "regularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two\n",
    "extremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external\n",
    "difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\n",
    "head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we\n",
    "may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\n",
    "deck:—where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to\n",
    "study practical cetology than here?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\n",
    "these heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a\n",
    "certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right\n",
    "Whale’s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head.\n",
    "As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to\n",
    "him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this\n",
    "dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the\n",
    "summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he\n",
    "is what the fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the two\n",
    "most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the\n",
    "head, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you\n",
    "narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\n",
    "fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\n",
    "magnitude of the head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is\n",
    "plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\n",
    "than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s\n",
    "eyes corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for\n",
    "yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects\n",
    "through your ears. You would find that you could only command some\n",
    "thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;\n",
    "and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\n",
    "straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\n",
    "be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\n",
    "behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\n",
    "same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes\n",
    "the front of a man—what, indeed, but his eyes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\n",
    "are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\n",
    "produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\n",
    "the whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\n",
    "solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating\n",
    "two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the\n",
    "impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,\n",
    "must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct\n",
    "picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and\n",
    "nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the\n",
    "world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with\n",
    "the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two\n",
    "distinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the\n",
    "whale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and\n",
    "to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\n",
    "visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\n",
    "hint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing\n",
    "is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\n",
    "whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience\n",
    "will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of\n",
    "things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and\n",
    "completely, to examine any two things—however large or however small—at\n",
    "one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side\n",
    "and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two\n",
    "objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in\n",
    "order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to\n",
    "bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\n",
    "consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in\n",
    "themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\n",
    "comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the\n",
    "same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on\n",
    "one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he\n",
    "can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\n",
    "simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\n",
    "problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\n",
    "incongruity in this comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\n",
    "extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\n",
    "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\n",
    "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\n",
    "proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\n",
    "divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an\n",
    "entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for\n",
    "hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf\n",
    "whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so\n",
    "wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With\n",
    "respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed\n",
    "between the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has\n",
    "an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered\n",
    "over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the\n",
    "world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear\n",
    "which is smaller than a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens\n",
    "of Herschel’s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of\n",
    "cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of\n",
    "hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your mind?\n",
    "Subtilize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant\n",
    "over the sperm whale’s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending\n",
    "by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not\n",
    "that the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we\n",
    "might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But\n",
    "let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What\n",
    "a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,\n",

    "But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems\n",
    "like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one\n",
    "end, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,\n",
    "and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,\n",
    "alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these\n",
    "spikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,\n",
    "when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there\n",
    "suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging\n",
    "straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a\n",
    "ship’s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\n",
    "sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his\n",
    "jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a\n",

    "\n",
    "In most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised\n",
    "artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting\n",
    "the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone\n",
    "with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,\n",
    "including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an\n",

    "rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag\n",
    "stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally\n",
    "forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed;\n",

    "CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right\n",
    "Whale’s head.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared to a\n",
    "Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly\n",
    "rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s head bears a rather\n",
    "inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred\n",
    "years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a\n",
    "shoemaker’s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the\n",
    "nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be\n",
    "lodged, she and all her progeny.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different\n",
    "aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit\n",
    "and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole\n",
    "head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in\n",
    "its sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,\n",
    "crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass—this green,\n",
    "barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the “crown,” and the\n",
    "Southern fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes\n",
    "solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,\n",
    "with a bird’s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those\n",
    "live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost\n",
    "sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the\n",
    "technical term “crown” also bestowed upon it; in which case you will\n",
    "take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a\n",
    "diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for\n",
    "him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a\n",
    "very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower\n",
    "lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by\n",
    "carpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a\n",
    "sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.\n",
    "The fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an\n",
    "important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when\n",
    "earthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery\n",
    "threshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at\n",
    "Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good\n",
    "Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet\n",
    "high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular\n",
    "ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us\n",
    "with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone,\n",
    "say three hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the\n",
    "head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere\n",
    "been cursorily mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with\n",
    "hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in\n",
    "whose intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes\n",
    "through the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of\n",
    "bone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious\n",
    "marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the\n",
    "creature’s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the\n",
    "certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the\n",
    "savor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we\n",
    "must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance\n",
    "will seem reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies\n",
    "concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous\n",
    "“whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a\n",
    "third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:\n",
    "“There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his\n",
    "upper _chop_, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.”\n",
    "\n",
    "*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or\n",
    "rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the\n",
    "upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts\n",
    "impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn\n",
    "countenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”\n",
    "“blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and\n",
    "other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has\n",
    "long been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time that the bone was\n",
    "in its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those\n",
    "ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as\n",
    "you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we\n",
    "nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a\n",
    "tent spread over the same bone.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,\n",
    "standing in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all\n",
    "these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not\n",
    "think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its\n",
    "thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest\n",
    "Turkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the\n",
    "mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting\n",
    "it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I\n",
    "should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that\n",
    "amount of oil.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started\n",
    "with—that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely\n",
    "different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no\n",
    "great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible\n",
    "of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are\n",
    "there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely\n",
    "anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external\n",
    "spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet\n",
    "lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other\n",
    "will not be very long in following.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’s there? It is the same\n",
    "he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now\n",
    "faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like\n",
    "placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the\n",
    "other head’s expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by\n",
    "accident against the vessel’s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw.\n",
    "Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical\n",
    "resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a\n",
    "Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in\n",
    "his latter years.\n",

    "CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have you,\n",
    "as a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front\n",
    "aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you\n",
    "investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some\n",
    "unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may\n",
    "be lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must either\n",
    "satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an\n",
    "infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events,\n",
    "perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.\n",
    "\n",
    "You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,\n",
    "the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the\n",
    "water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes\n",
    "considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long\n",
    "socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the\n",
    "mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as\n",
    "though your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you\n",
    "observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he\n",
    "has—his spout hole—is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes\n",
    "and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire\n",
    "length from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the\n",
    "front of the Sperm Whale’s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single\n",
    "organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are\n",
    "now to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part\n",
    "of the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and\n",
    "not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the\n",
    "full cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is\n",
    "as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents\n",
    "partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised\n",
    "of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that\n",
    "apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how\n",
    "the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.\n",
    "Just so with the head; but with this difference: about the head this\n",
    "envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable\n",
    "by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the\n",
    "sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds\n",
    "from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved\n",
    "with horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen\n",
    "chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the\n",
    "sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming\n",
    "contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold\n",
    "there a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and\n",
    "toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which\n",
    "would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By\n",
    "itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But\n",
    "supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as\n",
    "ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,\n",
    "capable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale,\n",
    "as far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the\n",
    "otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head\n",
    "altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated\n",
    "out of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its\n",
    "envelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has\n",
    "hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled\n",
    "honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and\n",
    "unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to\n",
    "atmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the\n",
    "irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and\n",
    "destructive of all elements contributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable\n",
    "wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a\n",
    "mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood\n",
    "is—by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest\n",
    "insect. So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the\n",
    "specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this\n",
    "expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more\n",
    "inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all\n",
    "ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the\n",
    "Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed\n",
    "the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your\n",
    "eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and\n",
    "sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for salamander\n",
    "giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials\n",

    "Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must\n",
    "know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated\n",
    "upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an\n",
    "inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower\n",
    "is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an\n",
    "unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the\n",
    "expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the\n",
    "forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two\n",
    "almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal\n",
    "wall of a thick tendinous substance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical\n",
    "mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a\n",
    "solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the\n",
    "steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both\n",
    "sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of\n",
    "oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand\n",
    "infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole\n",
    "extent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great\n",
    "Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is\n",
    "mystically carved in front, so the whale’s vast plaited forehead forms\n",
    "innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his\n",
    "wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished\n",
    "with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun\n",
    "of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily\n",
    "vintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,\n",
    "limpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found\n",
    "unalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains\n",
    "perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon\n",
    "begins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when\n",
    "the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale’s\n",
    "case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from\n",
    "unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and\n",
    "dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish\n",
    "business of securing what you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was\n",
    "coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not\n",
    "possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like\n",
    "the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm\n",
    "Whale’s case.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale\n",
    "embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since—as\n",
    "has been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the whole\n",
    "length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet\n",
    "for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the\n",
    "depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a\n",
    "ship’s side.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is brought\n",
    "close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the\n",
    "spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest\n",
    "a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly\n",
    "let out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the\n",
    "head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in\n",

    "combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that\n",

    "Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect\n",
    "posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the\n",
    "part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried\n",
    "with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,\n",
    "travelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that\n",
    "it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it\n",
    "is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down\n",
    "the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he\n",
    "lands on the summit of the head. There—still high elevated above the\n",
    "rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish\n",
    "Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A\n",
    "short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches\n",
    "for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business\n",
    "he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,\n",
    "sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time\n",
    "this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like\n",
    "a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the\n",
    "other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or\n",
    "three alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the\n",
    "Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.\n",
    "Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the\n",
    "bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word\n",
    "to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like\n",
    "a dairy-maid’s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the\n",
    "full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly\n",
    "emptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through\n",
    "the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the\n",
    "end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper\n",
    "and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone\n",
    "down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;\n",
    "several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once\n",
    "a queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild\n",
    "Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his\n",
    "one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or\n",
    "whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or\n",
    "whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without\n",
    "stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling\n",
    "now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came\n",
    "suckingly up—my God! poor Tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket\n",
    "in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of\n",
    "Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of\n",
    "sight!\n",
    "\n",
    "“Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first\n",
    "came to his senses. “Swing the bucket this way!” and putting one foot\n",
    "into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip\n",
    "itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost\n",
    "before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there\n",
    "was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before\n",
    "lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,\n",
    "as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only\n",
    "the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous\n",
    "depth to which he had sunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing\n",
    "the whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a\n",
    "sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,\n",
    "one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a\n",
    "vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship\n",
    "reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,\n",
    "upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be\n",
    "on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent\n",
    "motions of the head.\n",

    "holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he\n",
    "would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,\n",
    "rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the\n",
    "buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.\n",
    "\n",
    "“In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge\n",

    "rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass\n",
    "dropped into the sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the\n",
    "suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering\n",
    "copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging—now over the\n",
    "sailors’ heads, and now over the water—Daggoo, through a thick mist of\n",
    "spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,\n",
    "buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the\n",
    "sea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked\n",
    "figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen\n",
    "hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my\n",
    "brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the\n",
    "side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,\n",
    "and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands\n",
    "now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the\n",
    "ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch\n",
    "overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust\n",
    "upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust\n",
    "forth from the grass over a grave.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and\n",
    "soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and\n",
    "with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the\n",
    "waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was\n",
    "long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the\n",
    "slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side\n",
    "lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then\n",
    "dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,\n",
    "and so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first\n",
    "thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that\n",
    "was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;—he had\n",
    "thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a\n",
    "somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in\n",
    "the good old way—head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was\n",
    "doing as well as could be expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\n",
    "Queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was\n",
    "successfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and\n",
    "apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be\n",
    "forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing\n",
    "and boxing, riding and rowing.\n",

    "But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought\n",
    "the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and\n",
    "most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of\n",
    "a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at\n",
    "all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had\n",
    "been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the\n",
    "dense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded, hammered substance,\n",
    "as I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of\n",
    "which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking\n",
    "in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted\n",
    "by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it\n",
    "sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair\n",
    "chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.\n",
    "Yes, it was a running delivery, so it was.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious\n",
    "perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant\n",
    "spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber\n",
    "and sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be\n",
    "recalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey\n",
    "in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that\n",

    "Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He\n",
    "has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most\n",
    "conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and\n",
    "finally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that\n",
    "its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect\n",
    "the countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,\n",
    "cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable\n",
    "to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in\n",
    "keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the\n",
    "nose from Phidias’s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!\n",
    "Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his\n",
    "proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the\n",
    "sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is\n",
    "an added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As\n",
    "on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your\n",

    "creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip\n",
    "of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which\n",
    "like Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low,\n",
    "that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;\n",
    "and all above them in the forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the\n",
    "antlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters\n",
    "track the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this\n",
    "high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely\n",
    "amplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the\n",
    "Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other\n",
    "object in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one\n",
    "distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;\n",
    "he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a\n",
    "forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats,\n",
    "and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;\n",
    "though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In\n",

    "pyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale\n",

    "square.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet\n",

    "the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level\n",
    "base. But in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is\n",
    "angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent\n",
    "mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to\n",
    "bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater—in\n",
    "another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in\n",
    "depth—reposes the mere handful of this monster’s brain. The brain is at\n",
    "least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away\n",
    "behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the\n",
    "amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it\n",
    "secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny\n",
    "that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance\n",

    "strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it\n",
    "seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that\n",
    "mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in\n",
    "the creature’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his\n",
    "true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The\n",

    "If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view\n",
    "of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its\n",
    "resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from\n",
    "the same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down\n",
    "to the human magnitude) among a plate of men’s skulls, and you would\n",
    "involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on\n",
    "one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say—This man\n",
    "had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,\n",
    "considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and\n",
    "power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most\n",
    "exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain, you\n",
    "deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea\n",
    "for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine, you\n",
    "will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung\n",
    "necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the\n",
    "skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebræ are absolutely\n",
    "undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the\n",
    "Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once\n",
    "pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with\n",
    "the vertebræ of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the\n",
    "beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have\n",
    "omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the\n",
    "cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man’s\n",
    "character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel\n",
    "your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine\n",
    "never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in\n",
    "the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the\n",
    "world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial\n",
    "cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra\n",
    "the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being\n",
    "eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As\n",
    "it passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size, but\n",
    "for a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,\n",
    "this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance—the\n",
    "spinal cord—as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. And\n",
    "what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain’s\n",
    "cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal\n",
    "to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be\n",
    "unreasonable to survey and map out the whale’s spine phrenologically?\n",
    "For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his\n",
    "brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative\n",
    "magnitude of his spinal cord.\n",
    "\n",
    "But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\n",
    "would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the\n",
    "Sperm Whale’s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one\n",
    "of the larger vertebræ, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer\n",
    "convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call\n",
    "this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm\n",

    "At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the\n",
    "advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of\n",
    "retarding his rivals’ way, and at the same time economically\n",
    "accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The unmannerly Dutch dogger!” cried Stubb. “Pull now, men, like fifty\n",
    "thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d’ye say,\n",
    "Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces\n",

    "Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod’s\n",
    "three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,\n",
    "momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the\n",
    "headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up\n",
    "proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating\n",
    "cry of, “There she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down\n",
    "with the Yarman! Sail over him!”\n",
    "\n",
    "But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all\n",
    "their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not\n",
    "a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the\n",
    "blade of his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to\n",
    "free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick’s boat was nigh\n",
    "to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;—that\n",
    "was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took\n",
    "a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German’s\n",
    "quarter. An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the\n",
    "whale’s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was\n",
    "the foaming swell that he made.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was\n",
    "now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual\n",
    "tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of\n",
    "fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering\n",
    "flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank\n",
    "in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So\n",
    "have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles\n",
    "in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird\n",
    "has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the\n",
    "fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted\n",
    "in him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his\n",
    "spiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while\n",
    "still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there\n",
    "was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod’s\n",
    "boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick\n",
    "chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long\n",
    "dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all\n",
    "three tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to their\n",
    "feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their\n",
    "barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three\n",
    "Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and\n",
    "white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale’s headlong\n",
    "rush, bumped the German’s aside with such force, that both Derick and\n",
    "his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three\n",
    "flying keels.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing\n",
    "glance upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all\n",
    "right—I saw some sharks astern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—relieve\n",
    "distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel\n",
    "a sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a\n",
    "mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a\n",
    "tilbury on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to\n",
    "him that way; and there’s danger of being pitched out too, when you\n",
    "strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he’s going\n",
    "to Davy Jones—all a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this\n",
    "whale carries the everlasting mail!”\n",
    "\n",
    "But the monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\n",
    "tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round\n",
    "the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;\n",
    "while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would\n",
    "soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they\n",
    "caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at\n",
    "last—owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of\n",
    "the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue—the\n",
    "gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three\n",
    "sterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for\n",
    "some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more\n",
    "line, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have\n",
    "been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this “holding on,” as\n",
    "it is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from\n",
    "the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising\n",
    "again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the\n",
    "peril of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always\n",
    "the best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the\n",
    "stricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because,\n",
    "owing to the enormous surface of him—in a full grown sperm whale\n",
    "something less than 2000 square feet—the pressure of the water is\n",
    "immense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we\n",
    "ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how\n",
    "vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two\n",
    "hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty\n",
    "atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty\n",
    "line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on\n",
    "board.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\n",
    "into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\n",
    "sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;\n",
    "what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and\n",
    "placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in\n",
    "agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.\n",
    "Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan\n",
    "was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and\n",
    "to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was\n",
    "once so triumphantly said—“Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?\n",
    "or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him\n",
    "cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron\n",
    "as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;\n",
    "he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!” This the creature? this he? Oh!\n",
    "that unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength of\n",
    "a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the\n",
    "mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod’s fish-spears!\n",
    "\n",
    "In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats\n",
    "sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad\n",
    "enough to shade half Xerxes’ army. Who can tell how appalling to the\n",
    "wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!\n",
    "\n",
    "“Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly\n",
    "vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by\n",
    "magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every\n",
    "oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part\n",
    "from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce\n",
    "upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are\n",
    "scared from it into the sea.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’s rising.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s breadth\n",
    "could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all\n",
    "dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two\n",
    "ship’s lengths of the hunters.\n",
    "\n",
    "His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land\n",
    "animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins,\n",
    "whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly\n",
    "shut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose\n",
    "peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the\n",
    "blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a\n",
    "harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial\n",
    "system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of\n",
    "water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to\n",
    "pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of\n",
    "blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that\n",
    "he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period; even\n",
    "as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs\n",
    "of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled\n",
    "upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the\n",
    "lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the\n",
    "new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural\n",
    "spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending\n",
    "its affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet\n",
    "came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life,\n",
    "as they significantly call it, was untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\n",
    "his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\n",
    "revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were\n",
    "beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the\n",
    "noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale’s eyes\n",
    "had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.\n",
    "But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his\n",
    "blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light\n",
    "the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate\n",
    "the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to\n",
    "all. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a\n",
    "strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low\n",
    "down on the flank.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’s no need of that!”\n",
    "\n",
    "But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an\n",
    "ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\n",
    "than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift\n",
    "fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying\n",
    "crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask’s boat and marring\n",
    "the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he\n",
    "by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had\n",
    "made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,\n",
    "then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the\n",
    "white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most\n",
    "piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is\n",
    "gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled\n",
    "melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the\n",
    "ground—so the last long dying spout of the whale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\n",
    "showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\n",
    "Immediately, by Starbuck’s orders, lines were secured to it at\n",
    "different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\n",
    "whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By very\n",
    "heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred\n",
    "to her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest\n",
    "fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the\n",
    "body would at once sink to the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,\n",
    "the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his\n",
    "flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the\n",
    "stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured\n",
    "whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence\n",
    "of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have\n",
    "been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for\n",
    "the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a\n",
    "lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,\n",
    "the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And\n",
    "when? It might have been darted by some Nor’ West Indian long before\n",
    "America was discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\n",
    "cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further\n",
    "discoveries, by the ship’s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways\n",
    "to the sea, owing to the body’s immensely increasing tendency to sink.\n",
    "However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to\n",
    "the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the\n",
    "ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with\n",
    "the body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such\n",
    "was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the\n",
    "fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast\n",
    "them off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the\n",
    "other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a\n",
    "house. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her\n",
    "bulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\n",
    "dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the\n",
    "immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so\n",
    "low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at\n",
    "all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed\n",
    "added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going\n",
    "over.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Hold on, hold on, won’t ye?” cried Stubb to the body, “don’t be in\n",
    "such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something\n",
    "or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes,\n",
    "and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big\n",
    "chains.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s heavy\n",
    "hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing\n",
    "at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were\n",
    "given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific\n",
    "snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\n",
    "Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\n",
    "accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\n",
    "buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\n",
    "surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\n",
    "broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\n",
    "bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that\n",
    "this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so\n",
    "sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it\n",
    "is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with\n",
    "noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of\n",
    "life, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny,\n",
    "buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\n",
    "accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty\n",
    "Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable\n",
    "in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;\n",
    "his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this\n",
    "incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances\n",
    "where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale\n",
    "again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is\n",
    "obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious\n",
    "magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship\n",
    "could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings,\n",
    "among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of\n",
    "sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when\n",
    "the body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall\n",
    "have ascended again.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from\n",
    "the Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again\n",
    "lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a\n",
    "Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of\n",
    "its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back’s spout is\n",
    "so similar to the Sperm Whale’s, that by unskilful fishermen it is\n",
    "often mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were\n",
    "now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all\n",
    "sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared\n",
    "far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.\n",

    "There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the\n",
    "true method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up\n",
    "to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its\n",
    "great honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many\n",
    "great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other\n",
    "have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection\n",
    "that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a\n",
    "fraternity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to\n",
    "the eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale\n",
    "attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.\n",
    "Those were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms\n",
    "to succor the distressed, and not to fill men’s lamp-feeders. Every one\n",
    "knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely\n",
    "Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast,\n",
    "and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the\n",
    "prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and\n",
    "delivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit,\n",
    "rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as\n",
    "this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt\n",
    "this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian\n",
    "coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast\n",
    "skeleton of a whale, which the city’s legends and all the inhabitants\n",
    "asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew.\n",
    "When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in\n",
    "triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this\n",
    "story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda—indeed, by some supposed\n",
    "to be indirectly derived from it—is that famous story of St. George and\n",
    "the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many\n",
    "old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and\n",
    "often stand for each other. “Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a\n",
    "dragon of the sea,” saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in\n",
    "truth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it\n",
    "would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but\n",
    "encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle\n",
    "with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only\n",
    "a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march\n",
    "boldly up to a whale.\n",
    "\n",

    "creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely\n",
    "represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted\n",
    "on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance\n",

    "remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that\n",

    "CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in\n",
    "the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this\n",
    "historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some\n",
    "sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans\n",
    "of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale,\n",
    "and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did\n",
    "not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.\n",
    "\n",
    "One old Sag-Harbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\n",
    "story was this:—He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\n",
    "embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented\n",
    "Jonah’s whale with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only true with\n",
    "respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the\n",
    "varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this\n",
    "saying, “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small.\n",
    "But, to this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not\n",
    "necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the\n",
    "whale’s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And\n",
    "this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right\n",
    "Whale’s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and\n",
    "comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have\n",
    "ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right\n",
    "Whale is toothless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\n",
    "want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in\n",
    "reference to his incarcerated body and the whale’s gastric juices. But\n",
    "this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist\n",
    "supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a\n",
    "_dead_ whale—even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned\n",
    "their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has\n",
    "been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was\n",
    "thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his\n",
    "escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a\n",
    "figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some\n",
    "craft are nowadays christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor\n",
    "have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the\n",
    "whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver—an\n",
    "inflated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was\n",
    "saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all\n",
    "round. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was\n",
    "this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the\n",
    "Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere\n",
    "within three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much\n",
    "more than three days’ journey across from the nearest point of the\n",
    "Mediterranean coast. How is that?\n",
    "\n",
    "But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within\n",
    "that short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by\n",
    "the way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage\n",
    "through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up\n",
    "the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the\n",
    "complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of\n",
    "the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any\n",
    "whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah’s weathering the Cape of\n",
    "Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of\n",
    "that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and\n",
    "so make modern history a liar.\n",
    "\n",
    "But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his\n",
    "foolish pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing\n",
    "that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the\n",
    "sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and\n",
    "abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a\n",
    "Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah’s going to Nineveh\n",
    "via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the\n",
    "general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly\n",
    "enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah.\n",
    "And some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris’s\n",
    "Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which\n",

    "CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are\n",
    "anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an\n",
    "analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it\n",
    "to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly\n",
    "be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are\n",
    "hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to\n",
    "make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing\n",
    "his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau\n",
    "disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;\n",
    "crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in\n",
    "the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair\n",
    "from the craft’s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to\n",
    "some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the\n",
    "event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to\n",
    "them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered\n",
    "flight, as of Cleopatra’s barges from Actium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By great\n",
    "exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the\n",
    "stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal\n",
    "flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the\n",
    "planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became\n",
    "imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to\n",
    "haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and\n",
    "furious. What then remained?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and\n",
    "countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,\n",
    "none exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small\n",
    "sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It\n",
    "is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact\n",
    "and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is\n",
    "accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme\n",
    "headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or\n",
    "twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the\n",
    "harpoon, and also of a lighter material—pine. It is furnished with a\n",
    "small rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be\n",
    "hauled back to the hand after darting.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though\n",
    "the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is\n",
    "seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on\n",
    "account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as\n",
    "compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a\n",
    "general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before\n",
    "any pitchpoling comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and\n",
    "equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel\n",
    "in pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the\n",
    "flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet\n",
    "ahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along\n",
    "its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers\n",
    "up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in\n",
    "his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full\n",
    "before his waistband’s middle, he levels it at the whale; when,\n",
    "covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,\n",
    "thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon\n",
    "his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,\n",
    "balancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless\n",
    "impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming\n",
    "distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of\n",
    "sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.\n",
    "\n",
    "“That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’s immortal\n",
    "Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old\n",
    "Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,\n",
    "Tashtego, lad, I’d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we’d drink\n",
    "round it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we’d brew choice punch in the\n",
    "spread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the\n",
    "living stuff.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,\n",
    "the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful\n",
    "leash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is\n",
    "slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and\n",
    "mutely watches the monster die.\n",

    "CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.\n",
    "\n",
    "That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages\n",
    "before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and\n",
    "sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many\n",
    "sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,\n",
    "thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the\n",
    "whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should\n",
    "be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter\n",
    "minutes past one o’clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D.\n",
    "1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are,\n",
    "after all, really water, or nothing but vapor—this is surely a\n",
    "noteworthy thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\n",
    "contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\n",
    "gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\n",
    "is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a\n",
    "cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\n",
    "surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\n",
    "regular lungs, like a human being’s, the whale can only live by\n",
    "inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the\n",
    "necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot\n",
    "in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,\n",
    "the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the\n",
    "surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his\n",
    "mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the\n",
    "top of his head.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\n",
    "indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\n",
    "certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the\n",
    "blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I\n",
    "shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.\n",
    "Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be\n",
    "aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not\n",
    "fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\n",
    "live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the\n",
    "case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full\n",
    "hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or\n",
    "so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has\n",
    "no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine\n",
    "he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of\n",
    "vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are\n",
    "completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or\n",
    "more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of\n",
    "vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert\n",
    "carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\n",
    "supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\n",
    "indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable\n",
    "and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\n",
    "inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_,\n",
    "as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon\n",
    "rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period\n",
    "of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he\n",
    "stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy\n",
    "breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his\n",
    "seventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few\n",
    "breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up\n",
    "again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those\n",
    "seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full\n",
    "term below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates\n",
    "are different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale\n",
    "thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\n",
    "his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,\n",
    "that this necessity for the whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal\n",
    "hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast\n",
    "leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the\n",
    "sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great\n",
    "necessities that strike the victory to thee!\n",
    "\n",
    "In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for\n",
    "two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to\n",
    "attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the\n",
    "Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;\n",
    "if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,\n",
    "then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of\n",
    "smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at\n",
    "all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so\n",
    "clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power\n",
    "of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water\n",
    "or whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at\n",
    "on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no\n",
    "proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no\n",
    "violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting\n",
    "canal, and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is furnished\n",
    "with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of\n",
    "air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;\n",
    "unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he\n",
    "talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?\n",
    "Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this\n",
    "world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\n",
    "living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\n",
    "for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\n",
    "horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\n",
    "to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down\n",
    "in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether\n",
    "this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout\n",
    "of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether\n",
    "that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\n",
    "discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth\n",
    "indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be\n",
    "proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the\n",
    "spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,\n",
    "when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale’s\n",
    "food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he\n",
    "would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your\n",
    "watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating\n",
    "rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of\n",
    "respiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!\n",
    "You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not\n",
    "tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to\n",
    "settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the\n",
    "knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand\n",
    "in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\n",
    "it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,\n",
    "when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view\n",
    "of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all\n",
    "around him. And if at such times you should think that you really\n",
    "perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are\n",
    "not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are\n",
    "not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole\n",
    "fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head? For\n",
    "even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with\n",
    "his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then,\n",
    "the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a\n",
    "blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\n",
    "rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\n",
    "precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\n",
    "into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\n",
    "this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\n",
    "slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will\n",
    "often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of\n",
    "the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer\n",
    "contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or\n",
    "otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.\n",
    "Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to\n",
    "evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt\n",
    "it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind\n",
    "you. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is\n",
    "to let this deadly spout alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My\n",
    "hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides\n",
    "other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\n",
    "touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I\n",
    "account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed\n",
    "fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other\n",
    "whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am\n",
    "convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\n",
    "Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes\n",
    "up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep\n",
    "thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the\n",
    "curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected\n",
    "there, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over\n",
    "my head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep\n",
    "thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an\n",
    "August noon; this seems an additional argument for the above\n",
    "supposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\n",
    "behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild\n",
    "head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable\n",
    "contemplations, and that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified\n",
    "by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.\n",
    "For, d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate\n",
    "vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my\n",
    "mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a\n",
    "heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;\n",
    "but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of\n",
    "all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this\n",
    "combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who\n",
    "regards them both with equal eye.\n",

    "CHAPTER 86. The Tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,\n",
    "and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial,\n",
    "I celebrate a tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point\n",
    "of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises\n",
    "upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.\n",
    "The compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat\n",
    "palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in\n",
    "thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap,\n",
    "then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy\n",
    "between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely\n",
    "defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost\n",
    "expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed\n",
    "twenty feet across.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\n",
    "into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:—upper,\n",
    "middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long\n",
    "and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\n",
    "crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as\n",
    "anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman\n",
    "walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin\n",
    "course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful\n",
    "relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the\n",
    "great strength of the masonry.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,\n",
    "the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of\n",
    "muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins\n",
    "and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and\n",
    "largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent\n",
    "measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.\n",
    "Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor does this—its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful\n",
    "flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a\n",
    "Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most\n",
    "appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or\n",
    "harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly\n",
    "beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied\n",
    "tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved\n",
    "Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the\n",
    "linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with\n",
    "the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.\n",
    "When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what\n",
    "robustness is there. And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in\n",
    "the Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which\n",
    "his idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures, so\n",
    "destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but\n",
    "the mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on\n",
    "all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his\n",
    "teachings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\n",
    "wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it\n",
    "be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein\n",
    "no fairy’s arm can transcend it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\n",
    "progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;\n",
    "Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\n",
    "\n",
    "First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan’s tail acts in a\n",
    "different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never\n",
    "wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the\n",
    "whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\n",
    "forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is\n",
    "this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster\n",
    "when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\n",
    "fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his\n",
    "conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In\n",
    "striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the\n",
    "blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed\n",
    "air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply\n",
    "irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only\n",
    "salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the\n",
    "opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the\n",
    "whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a\n",
    "dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the\n",
    "most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received\n",
    "in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child’s play. Some one\n",
    "strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\n",
    "the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\n",
    "there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\n",
    "elephant’s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\n",
    "sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\n",
    "slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\n",
    "the sea; and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that sailor,\n",
    "whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!\n",
    "Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\n",
    "Darmonodes’ elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low\n",
    "salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\n",
    "zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not\n",
    "possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet\n",
    "another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his\n",
    "trunk and extracted the dart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\n",
    "middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence\n",
    "of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\n",
    "hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his\n",
    "tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\n",
    "thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a\n",
    "great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of\n",
    "vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that\n",
    "that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes\n",
    "lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely\n",
    "out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into\n",
    "the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are\n",
    "tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they\n",
    "downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime _breach_—somewhere\n",
    "else to be described—this peaking of the whale’s flukes is perhaps the\n",
    "grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless\n",
    "profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\n",
    "highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting\n",
    "forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in\n",
    "gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the\n",
    "Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the\n",
    "archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that\n",
    "crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,\n",
    "all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with\n",
    "peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment\n",
    "of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of\n",
    "the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\n",
    "elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most\n",
    "devout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military\n",
    "elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks\n",
    "uplifted in the profoundest silence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\n",
    "elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\n",
    "of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite\n",
    "organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\n",
    "respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to\n",
    "Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan’s tail, his trunk is but the\n",
    "stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant’s trunk were\n",
    "as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and\n",
    "crash of the sperm whale’s ponderous flukes, which in repeated\n",
    "instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their\n",
    "oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his\n",
    "balls.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and\n",
    "the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the\n",
    "elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does\n",
    "to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of\n",
    "curious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the\n",
    "elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then\n",
    "elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my\n",
    "inability to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which,\n",
    "though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly\n",
    "inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are\n",
    "these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared them\n",
    "akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these\n",
    "methods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting\n",
    "other motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,\n",
    "and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I\n",
    "may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I\n",
    "know not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much\n",
    "more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my\n",
    "back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.\n",
    "But I cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will\n",
    "about his face, I say again he has no face.\n",

    "The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from\n",

    "mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and\n",

    "now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs\n",
    "no sustenance but what’s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the\n",
    "whaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be\n",
    "transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries\n",
    "no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a\n",
    "whole lake’s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with\n",

    "Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of\n",
    "the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an\n",
    "excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and\n",

    "admonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the\n",
    "land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the\n",
    "fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was\n",
    "descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game\n",

    "customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle\n",
    "of singular magnificence saluted us.\n",

    "thousands on thousands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and\n",
    "forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a\n",
    "continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the\n",
    "noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right\n",

    "rising and falling away to leeward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of\n",
    "the sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the\n",
    "air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed\n",
    "like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried\n",
    "of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.\n",
    "\n",
    "As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,\n",
    "accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in\n",
    "their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the\n",
    "plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward\n",
    "through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their\n",

    "\n",
    "Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers\n",
    "handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet\n",
    "suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that\n",
    "chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy\n",
    "into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their\n",
    "number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby\n",
    "Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped\n",
    "white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with\n",
    "stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans\n",
    "before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly\n",
    "directing attention to something in our wake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our\n",
    "rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling\n",
    "something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so\n",
    "completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally\n",
    "disappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved\n",
    "in his pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to\n",
    "wet the sails;—Malays, sir, and after us!”\n",
    "\n",
    "As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should\n",
    "fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in\n",
    "hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the\n",
    "swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how\n",
    "very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on\n",
    "to her own chosen pursuit,—mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that\n",
    "they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in\n",
    "his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one\n",
    "the bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_; some such fancy as the above\n",
    "seemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery\n",
    "defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that\n",
    "through that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that\n",
    "through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his\n",
    "deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates\n",
    "and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with\n",
    "their curses;—when all these conceits had passed through his brain,\n",
    "Ahab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after\n",
    "some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the\n",
    "firm thing from its place.\n",
    "\n",
    "But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\n",
    "when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\n",
    "Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra\n",
    "side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\n",
    "harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been\n",
    "gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\n",
    "victoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake\n",
    "of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the\n",
    "ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to\n",
    "spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed\n",
    "wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three\n",
    "keels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in their rear,—than\n",
    "they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that\n",
    "their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved\n",
    "on with redoubled velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and\n",
    "after several hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the\n",
    "chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating\n",
    "token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange\n",
    "perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it\n",
    "in the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns in\n",
    "which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now\n",
    "broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus’ elephants in\n",
    "the Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with\n",
    "consternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles,\n",
    "and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick\n",
    "spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was\n",
    "still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely\n",
    "paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled\n",
    "ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple\n",
    "sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not\n",
    "possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional\n",
    "timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though\n",
    "banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the\n",
    "West have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human\n",
    "beings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit,\n",
    "they will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the\n",
    "outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each\n",
    "other to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the\n",
    "strangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts\n",
    "of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\n",
    "yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\n",
    "retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in\n",
    "those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone\n",
    "whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes’ time,\n",
    "Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray\n",
    "in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered\n",
    "straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part\n",
    "of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise\n",
    "unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;\n",
    "yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the\n",
    "fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the\n",
    "frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a\n",
    "delirious throb.\n",
    "\n",
    "As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of\n",
    "speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we\n",
    "thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by\n",
    "the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was\n",
    "like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer\n",
    "through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what\n",
    "moment it may be locked in and crushed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\n",
    "from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away\n",
    "from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the\n",
    "time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our\n",
    "way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no\n",
    "time to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their\n",
    "wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to\n",
    "the shouting part of the business. “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried\n",
    "one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,\n",
    "and for an instant threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail,\n",
    "there!” cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed\n",
    "calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.\n",
    "\n",
    "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented\n",
    "by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of\n",
    "equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each\n",
    "other’s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then\n",
    "attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line\n",
    "being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is\n",
    "chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more\n",
    "whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But\n",
    "sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you\n",
    "must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you\n",
    "must wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.\n",
    "Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into\n",
    "requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and\n",
    "second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly\n",
    "running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing\n",
    "drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But\n",
    "upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy\n",
    "wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an\n",
    "instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the\n",
    "boat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea\n",
    "came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and\n",
    "shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it\n",
    "not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly\n",
    "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\n",
    "the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So\n",
    "that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale\n",
    "sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\n",
    "momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the\n",
    "shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\n",
    "valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost\n",
    "whales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea\n",
    "presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by\n",
    "the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods.\n",
    "Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the\n",
    "heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted distance we\n",
    "beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive\n",
    "pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,\n",
    "like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to\n",
    "shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the\n",
    "middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the\n",
    "density of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding\n",
    "the embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at\n",
    "present afforded us. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that\n",
    "hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us\n",
    "up. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by\n",
    "small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\n",
    "outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in\n",
    "any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by\n",
    "the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square\n",
    "miles. At any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be\n",
    "deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed\n",
    "playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this\n",
    "circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely\n",
    "locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd\n",
    "had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its\n",
    "stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way\n",
    "innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller\n",
    "whales—now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the\n",
    "lake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still\n",
    "becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like\n",
    "household dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,\n",
    "and touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\n",
    "domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched\n",
    "their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the\n",
    "time refrained from darting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\n",
    "stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended\n",
    "in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\n",
    "whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become\n",
    "mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth\n",
    "exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will\n",
    "calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two\n",
    "different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,\n",
    "be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so\n",
    "did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at\n",
    "us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.\n",
    "Floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One\n",
    "of these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a\n",
    "day old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six\n",
    "feet in girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed\n",
    "scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately\n",
    "occupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready\n",
    "for the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow.\n",
    "The delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly\n",
    "retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived\n",
    "from foreign parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast! him\n",
    "fast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, one little!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down.\n",
    "\n",
    "As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds\n",
    "of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and\n",
    "shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling\n",
    "towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord\n",
    "of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to\n",
    "its dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this\n",
    "natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the\n",
    "hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest\n",
    "secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We\n",
    "saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but\n",
    "unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\n",
    "gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but\n",
    "one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an\n",
    "Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,\n",
    "curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts\n",
    "themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious\n",
    "parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s\n",
    "pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk\n",
    "is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well\n",
    "with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales\n",
    "salute _more hominum_.\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and\n",
    "affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and\n",
    "fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled\n",
    "in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of\n",
    "my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;\n",
    "and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down\n",
    "and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\n",
    "spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,\n",
    "still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or\n",
    "possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance\n",
    "of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight\n",
    "of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro\n",
    "across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is\n",
    "sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful\n",
    "and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or\n",
    "maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled\n",
    "cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A\n",
    "whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not\n",
    "effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying\n",
    "along with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony\n",
    "of the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the\n",
    "lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying\n",
    "dismay wherever he went.\n",
    "\n",
    "But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\n",
    "spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed\n",
    "to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first\n",
    "the intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived\n",
    "that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale\n",
    "had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run\n",
    "away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope\n",
    "attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the\n",
    "harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose\n",
    "from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning\n",
    "through the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and\n",
    "tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own\n",
    "comrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\n",
    "stationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake\n",
    "began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by\n",
    "half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to\n",
    "heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;\n",
    "in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central\n",
    "circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was\n",
    "departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the\n",
    "tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in\n",
    "Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner\n",
    "centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly\n",
    "Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe your\n",
    "oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,\n",
    "you Queequeg—the whale there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—stand up,\n",
    "and stay so! Spring, men—pull, men; never mind their backs—scrape\n",
    "them!—scrape away!”\n",
    "\n",
    "The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a\n",
    "narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate\n",
    "endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way\n",
    "rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.\n",
    "After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into\n",
    "what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random\n",
    "whales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was\n",
    "cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg’s hat, who, while standing in\n",
    "the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his\n",
    "head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad\n",
    "flukes close by.\n",
    "\n",
    "Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon\n",
    "resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having\n",
    "clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their\n",
    "onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;\n",
    "but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged\n",
    "whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask\n",
    "had killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of\n",
    "which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at\n",
    "hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both\n",
    "to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession,\n",
    "should the boats of any other ship draw near.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious\n",
    "saying in the Fishery,—the more whales the less fish. Of all the\n",
    "drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for\n",
    "the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some\n",
    "other craft than the Pequod.\n",

    "CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm\n",
    "Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those\n",
    "vast aggregations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must\n",
    "have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are\n",
    "occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.\n",
    "Such bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those\n",
    "composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young\n",
    "vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a\n",
    "male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces\n",
    "his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his\n",
    "ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about\n",
    "over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and\n",
    "endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his\n",
    "concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest\n",
    "leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more\n",
    "than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are\n",
    "comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen\n",
    "yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the\n",
    "whole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\n",
    "ramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in\n",
    "leisurely search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the\n",
    "full flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,\n",
    "perhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating\n",
    "summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have\n",
    "lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for\n",
    "the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so\n",
    "evade the other excessive temperature of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange\n",
    "suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\n",
    "interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan\n",
    "coming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the\n",
    "ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases\n",
    "him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are\n",
    "to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do\n",
    "what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of\n",
    "his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often\n",
    "cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with\n",
    "the whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They\n",
    "fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and\n",
    "so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their\n",
    "antlers. Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these\n",
    "encounters,—furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some\n",
    "instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.\n",
    "\n",
    "But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at\n",
    "the first rush of the harem’s lord, then is it very diverting to watch\n",
    "that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and\n",
    "revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,\n",
    "like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.\n",
    "Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give\n",
    "chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish\n",
    "of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the\n",
    "sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must\n",
    "take care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For\n",
    "like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my\n",
    "Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower;\n",
    "and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all\n",
    "over the world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as\n",
    "the ardour of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as\n",
    "reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude\n",
    "overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the\n",
    "love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,\n",
    "admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to\n",
    "an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians\n",
    "and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from\n",

    "His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the\n",

    "The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,\n",
    "necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale\n",
    "fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.\n",
    "\n",
    "It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,\n",
    "a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed\n",
    "and captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised\n",
    "many minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For\n",
    "example,—after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the\n",
    "body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and\n",
    "drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a\n",

    "undisputed law applicable to all cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative\n",
    "enactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in\n",
    "A.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling\n",
    "law, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and\n",
    "lawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse\n",

    "II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable\n",
    "brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to\n",
    "expound it.\n",
    "\n",
    "First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,\n",
    "when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at\n",
    "all controllable by the occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a\n",
    "nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the\n",
    "same. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any\n",
    "other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it\n",
    "plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well\n",
    "as their intention so to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen\n",
    "themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the\n",
    "Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and\n",
    "honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where\n",
    "it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim\n",
    "possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But\n",
    "others are by no means so scrupulous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated\n",
    "in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of\n",
    "a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had\n",
    "succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of\n",
    "their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat\n",
    "itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up\n",
    "with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it\n",
    "before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were\n",
    "remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs’\n",
    "teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had\n",
    "done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had\n",
    "remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore\n",
    "the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale,\n",
    "line, harpoons, and boat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the\n",
    "judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to\n",
    "illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,\n",
    "wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s\n",
    "viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\n",
    "the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to\n",
    "recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then\n",
    "supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally\n",
    "harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\n",
    "the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned\n",
    "her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and\n",
    "therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then\n",
    "became that subsequent gentleman’s property, along with whatever\n",
    "harpoon might have been found sticking in her.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the\n",
    "whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very\n",
    "learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the boat, he\n",
    "awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to\n",
    "save their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,\n",
    "harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because\n",
    "it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons\n",
    "and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)\n",
    "acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards\n",
    "took the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took\n",
    "the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might\n",
    "possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the\n",
    "matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws\n",
    "previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in\n",
    "the above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish,\n",
    "I say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human\n",
    "jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of\n",
    "sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines,\n",
    "has but two props to stand on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it not a saying in every one’s mouth, Possession is half of the law:\n",
    "that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often\n",
    "possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of\n",
    "Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession\n",
    "is the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow’s\n",

    "car, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first\n",
    "place, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is\n",
    "still in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that\n",
    "happened within the last two years.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one\n",
    "of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and\n",
    "beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from\n",
    "the shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the\n",
    "jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.\n",
    "Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal\n",
    "emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment\n",
    "his. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their\n",
    "trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their\n",
    "fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good £150 from the\n",
    "precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their\n",
    "wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their\n",
    "respective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and\n",

    "It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke\n",
    "to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs\n",
    "inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested\n",
    "with that right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon\n",
    "gives us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs\n",
    "to the King and Queen, “because of its superior excellence.” And by the\n",
    "soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such\n",

    "There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers—the whale\n",

    "nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown’s ordinary revenue. I\n",
    "know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by\n",
    "inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same\n",
    "way as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head\n",

    "yet the word _rose_, and the bulbous figure-head put together,\n",
    "sufficiently explained the whole to him.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will\n",
    "do very well; but how like all creation it smells!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he\n",
    "had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close\n",
    "to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\n",
    "bawled—“Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that\n",
    "speak English?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be\n",
    "the chief-mate.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“_What_ whale?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The _White_ Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\n",
    "\n",
    "“Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning\n",
    "over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two\n",
    "hands into a trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab\n",
    "retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\n",
    "\n",
    "He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the\n",
    "chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of\n",
    "bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What’s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I wish it was broken, or that I didn’t have any nose at all!” answered\n",
    "the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very\n",
    "much. “But what are you holding _yours_ for?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t\n",
    "it? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will\n",
    "ye, Bouton-de-Rose?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared the Guernseyman,\n",
    "flying into a sudden passion.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those\n",
    "whales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do\n",
    "you know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\n",
    "such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn’t a gill in his\n",
    "whole carcase.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe\n",
    "it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But\n",
    "come aboard, and mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t me; and so I’ll\n",
    "get out of this dirty scrape.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb,\n",
    "and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene\n",
    "presented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were\n",
    "getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked\n",
    "rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good\n",
    "humor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many\n",
    "jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up\n",
    "to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch\n",
    "the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their\n",
    "nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\n",
    "off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it\n",
    "constantly filled their olfactories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from\n",
    "the Captain’s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a\n",
    "fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from\n",
    "within. This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\n",
    "remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\n",
    "to the Captain’s round-house (_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the\n",
    "pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\n",
    "indignations at times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\n",
    "Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\n",
    "expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who\n",
    "had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.\n",
    "Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man\n",
    "had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore\n",
    "held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and\n",
    "confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\n",
    "for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all\n",
    "dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan\n",
    "of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter’s office,\n",
    "was to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and\n",
    "as for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost\n",
    "in him during the interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a\n",
    "small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with\n",
    "large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet\n",
    "vest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now\n",
    "politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put\n",
    "on the aspect of interpreting between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What shall I say to him first?” said he.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why,” said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, “you\n",
    "may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,\n",
    "though I don’t pretend to be a judge.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He says, Monsieur,” said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\n",
    "captain, “that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\n",
    "and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a\n",
    "blasted whale they had brought alongside.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What now?” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\n",
    "carefully, I’m quite certain that he’s no more fit to command a\n",
    "whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he’s a\n",
    "baboon.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,\n",
    "is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures\n",
    "us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\n",
    "crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast\n",
    "loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What now?” said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to\n",
    "them.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that—that—in fact,\n",
    "tell him I’ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody\n",
    "else.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He says, Monsieur, that he’s very happy to have been of any service to\n",
    "us.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\n",
    "(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into\n",
    "his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\n",
    "\n",
    "“He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,” said the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Thank him heartily; but tell him it’s against my principles to drink\n",
    "with the man I’ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He says, Monsieur, that his principles won’t admit of his drinking;\n",
    "but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur\n",
    "had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales,\n",
    "for it’s so calm they won’t drift.”\n",
    "\n",
    "By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed\n",
    "the Guernsey-man to this effect,—that having a long tow-line in his\n",
    "boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the\n",
    "lighter whale of the two from the ship’s side. While the Frenchman’s\n",
    "boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb\n",
    "benevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously\n",
    "slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;\n",
    "hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while\n",
    "the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb’s whale. Whereupon Stubb\n",
    "quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give\n",
    "notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his\n",
    "unrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an\n",
    "excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost\n",
    "have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at\n",
    "length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up\n",
    "old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat’s crew\n",
    "were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking\n",
    "as anxious as gold-hunters.\n",
    "\n",
    "And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\n",
    "screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning\n",
    "to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased,\n",
    "when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a\n",
    "faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells\n",
    "without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then\n",
    "along with another, without at all blending with it for a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I have it, I have it,” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something\n",
    "in the subterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of\n",
    "something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\n",
    "cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with\n",
    "your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this,\n",
    "good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\n",
    "druggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably\n",
    "lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were\n",
    "it not for impatient Ahab’s loud command to Stubb to desist, and come\n",
    "on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 92. Ambergris.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an\n",
    "article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\n",
    "Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that\n",
    "subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,\n",
    "the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem\n",
    "to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound\n",
    "for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber,\n",
    "though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far\n",
    "inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.\n",
    "Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,\n",
    "used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris\n",
    "is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely\n",
    "used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and\n",
    "pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for\n",
    "the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome.\n",
    "Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\n",
    "regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\n",
    "sick whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the\n",
    "cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to\n",
    "cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\n",
    "three or four boat loads of Brandreth’s pills, and then running out of\n",
    "harm’s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\n",
    "certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be\n",
    "sailors’ trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were\n",
    "nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\n",
    "found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that\n",
    "saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;\n",
    "how that we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise\n",
    "call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the\n",
    "best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of\n",
    "ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is\n",
    "the worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\n",
    "cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\n",
    "whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,\n",
    "might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\n",
    "of the Frenchman’s two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous\n",
    "aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is\n",
    "throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to\n",
    "rebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this\n",
    "odious stigma originate?\n",
    "\n",
    "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\n",
    "Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because\n",
    "those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea\n",
    "as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh\n",
    "blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks,\n",
    "and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those\n",
    "Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed,\n",
    "forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking\n",
    "into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the\n",
    "Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising\n",
    "from excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a\n",
    "Lying-in Hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\n",
    "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former\n",
    "times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which\n",
    "latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great\n",
    "work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports\n",
    "(smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to\n",
    "afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried\n",
    "out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a\n",
    "collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works\n",
    "were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But\n",
    "all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a\n",
    "voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with\n",
    "oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling\n",
    "out; and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.\n",
    "The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a\n",
    "species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be\n",
    "recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew\n",
    "in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be\n",
    "otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high\n",
    "health; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it\n",
    "is true, seldom in the open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm\n",
    "Whale’s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented\n",
    "lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the\n",
    "Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be\n",
    "to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh,\n",
    "which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the Great?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 93. The Castaway.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most\n",
    "significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod’s crew;\n",
    "an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes\n",
    "madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying\n",
    "prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.\n",
    "Some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is\n",
    "to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general\n",
    "thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising\n",
    "the boats’ crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy,\n",
    "or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a\n",
    "ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by\n",
    "nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before;\n",
    "ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so\n",
    "gloomy-jolly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and\n",
    "a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven\n",
    "in one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull\n",
    "and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at\n",
    "bottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness\n",
    "peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and\n",
    "festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race. For blacks,\n",
    "the year’s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five\n",
    "Fourth of Julys and New Year’s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that\n",
    "this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy;\n",
    "behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king’s cabinets. But Pip loved\n",
    "life, and all life’s peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking\n",
    "business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had\n",
    "most sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen,\n",
    "what was thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be\n",
    "luridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him\n",
    "off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland\n",
    "County in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler’s frolic on\n",
    "the green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned\n",
    "the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the\n",
    "clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the\n",
    "pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning\n",
    "jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he\n",
    "lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun,\n",
    "but by some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences,\n",
    "infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest\n",
    "symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from\n",
    "the King of Hell. But let us to the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb’s after-oarsman\n",
    "chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\n",
    "and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\n",
    "but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\n",
    "therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing\n",
    "him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness\n",
    "to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\n",
    "the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\n",
    "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. The\n",
    "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\n",
    "hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale\n",
    "line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as\n",
    "to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That\n",
    "instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly\n",
    "straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of\n",
    "the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken\n",
    "several turns around his chest and neck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He\n",
    "hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he\n",
    "suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\n",
    "exclaimed interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime Pip’s blue, choked face\n",
    "plainly looked, Do, for God’s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than\n",
    "half a minute, this entire thing happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\n",
    "saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by\n",
    "yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these\n",
    "irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,\n",
    "but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,\n",
    "unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never\n",
    "jump from a boat, Pip, except—but all the rest was indefinite, as the\n",
    "soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, _Stick to the boat_, is your\n",
    "true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when _Leap from\n",
    "the boat_, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if\n",
    "he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be\n",
    "leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly\n",
    "dropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, “Stick to\n",
    "the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won’t pick you up if you jump; mind\n",
    "that. We can’t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would\n",
    "sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in\n",
    "mind, and don’t jump any more.” Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted,\n",
    "that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,\n",
    "which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was\n",
    "under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this\n",
    "time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started\n",
    "to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller’s\n",
    "trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful,\n",
    "bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly\n",
    "stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater’s skin\n",
    "hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip’s\n",
    "ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when\n",
    "he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb’s inexorable back was turned upon him;\n",
    "and the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless\n",
    "ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor\n",
    "Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely\n",
    "castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\n",
    "practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful\n",
    "lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the\n",
    "middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,\n",
    "how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea—mark how closely\n",
    "they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No;\n",
    "he did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,\n",
    "and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip\n",
    "very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations\n",
    "towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always\n",
    "manifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances\n",
    "not unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so\n",
    "called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to\n",
    "military navies and armies.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly\n",
    "spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and\n",
    "Stubb’s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent\n",
    "upon his fish, that Pip’s ringed horizon began to expand around him\n",
    "miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;\n",
    "but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such,\n",
    "at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body\n",
    "up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.\n",
    "Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of\n",
    "the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;\n",
    "and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the\n",
    "joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,\n",
    "God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters\n",
    "heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God’s foot upon the treadle of the\n",
    "loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So\n",
    "man’s insanity is heaven’s sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,\n",
    "man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is\n",
    "absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,\n",
    "indifferent as his God.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that\n",
    "fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what\n",
    "like abandonment befell myself.\n",

    "CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of the Hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "That whale of Stubb’s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the\n",
    "Pequod’s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations\n",
    "previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of\n",
    "the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in\n",
    "dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and\n",
    "when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated\n",
    "ere going to the try-works, of which anon.\n",
    "\n",
    "It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with\n",
    "several others, I sat down before a large Constantine’s bath of it, I\n",
    "found it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about\n",
    "in the liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back\n",
    "into fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this\n",
    "sperm was such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener!\n",
    "such a softener! such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it\n",
    "for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it\n",
    "were, to serpentine and spiralise.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter\n",
    "exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under\n",
    "indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands\n",
    "among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost\n",
    "within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all\n",
    "their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that\n",
    "uncontaminated aroma,—literally and truly, like the smell of spring\n",
    "violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky\n",
    "meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible\n",
    "sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit\n",
    "the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in\n",
    "allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely\n",
    "free from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort\n",
    "whatsoever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm\n",
    "till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a\n",
    "strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly\n",
    "squeezing my co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their hands for the\n",
    "gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving\n",
    "feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually\n",
    "squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as\n",
    "much as to say,—Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish\n",
    "any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come;\n",
    "let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into\n",
    "each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and\n",
    "sperm of kindness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since\n",
    "by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all\n",
    "cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of\n",
    "attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the\n",
    "fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the\n",
    "fireside, the country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready\n",
    "to squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I\n",
    "saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of\n",
    "spermaceti.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things\n",
    "akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the\n",
    "try-works.\n",
    "\n",
    "First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering\n",
    "part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It\n",
    "is tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some\n",
    "oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut\n",
    "into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like\n",
    "blocks of Berkshire marble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the\n",
    "whale’s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and\n",
    "often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is\n",
    "a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name\n",
    "imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked\n",
    "snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and\n",
    "purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,\n",
    "it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I\n",
    "stole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should\n",
    "conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have\n",
    "tasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after the\n",
    "venison season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an\n",
    "unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in\n",
    "the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling\n",
    "adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation\n",
    "original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance.\n",
    "It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the\n",
    "tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I\n",
    "hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case,\n",
    "coalescing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but\n",
    "sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the\n",
    "dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the\n",
    "Greenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those\n",
    "inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale’s\n",
    "vocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman’s\n",
    "nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering\n",
    "part of Leviathan’s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the\n",
    "rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along\n",
    "the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless\n",
    "blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at\n",
    "once to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its\n",
    "inmates. This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for\n",
    "the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the\n",
    "proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a\n",
    "scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by\n",
    "a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They\n",
    "generally go in pairs,—a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The\n",
    "whaling-pike is similar to a frigate’s boarding-weapon of the same\n",
    "name. The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the\n",
    "gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from\n",
    "slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the\n",
    "spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into\n",
    "the portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the\n",
    "spademan’s feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes\n",
    "irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of\n",
    "his own toes, or one of his assistants’, would you be very much\n",
    "astonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.\n",

    "Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this\n",
    "post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the\n",
    "windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small\n",
    "curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen\n",
    "there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous\n",
    "cistern in the whale’s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower\n",
    "jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so\n",
    "surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,—longer than\n",
    "a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and\n",
    "jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it\n",
    "is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that\n",
    "found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for\n",
    "worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the\n",
    "idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly\n",
    "set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and\n",
    "assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners\n",
    "call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a\n",
    "grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the\n",
    "forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt,\n",
    "as an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt\n",
    "inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as\n",
    "almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in\n",
    "the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some\n",
    "three feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two\n",
    "slits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself\n",
    "bodily into it. The mincer now stands before you invested in the full\n",
    "canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this\n",
    "investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the\n",
    "peculiar functions of his office.\n",
    "\n",
    "That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the\n",
    "pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,\n",
    "planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath\n",
    "it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt\n",
    "orator’s desk. Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit;\n",

    "*Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates\n",

    "boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably\n",
    "increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.\n",

    "CHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly\n",
    "distinguished by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the\n",
    "most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the\n",
    "completed ship. It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were\n",
    "transported to her planks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most\n",
    "roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,\n",
    "fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and\n",
    "mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The\n",
    "foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly\n",
    "secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all\n",
    "sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased\n",
    "with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened\n",
    "hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in\n",
    "number, and each of several barrels’ capacity. When not in use, they\n",
    "are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone\n",
    "and sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the\n",
    "night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil\n",
    "themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them—one\n",
    "man in each pot, side by side—many confidential communications are\n",
    "carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound\n",
    "mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod,\n",
    "with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first\n",
    "indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies\n",
    "gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from\n",
    "any point in precisely the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare\n",
    "masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of\n",
    "the furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted\n",
    "with heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented\n",
    "from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir\n",
    "extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel\n",
    "inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as\n",
    "fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct\n",
    "from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was about nine o’clock at night that the Pequod’s try-works were\n",
    "first started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee\n",
    "the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "“All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the\n",
    "works.” This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting\n",
    "his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said\n",
    "that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed\n",
    "for a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of\n",
    "quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out,\n",
    "the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still\n",
    "contains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed\n",
    "the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming\n",
    "misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by\n",
    "his own body. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is\n",
    "horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you\n",
    "must live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor\n",
    "about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells\n",
    "like the left wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the\n",
    "pit.\n",
    "\n",
    "By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the\n",
    "carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean\n",
    "darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce\n",
    "flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and\n",
    "illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek\n",
    "fire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to\n",
    "some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the\n",
    "bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad\n",
    "sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and\n",
    "folded them in conflagrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide\n",
    "hearth in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of\n",
    "the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship’s stokers. With huge\n",
    "pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding\n",
    "pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted,\n",
    "curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled\n",
    "away in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of\n",
    "the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces.\n",
    "Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden\n",
    "hearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the\n",
    "watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the\n",
    "fire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny\n",
    "features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards,\n",
    "and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were\n",
    "strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they\n",
    "narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror\n",
    "told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards\n",
    "out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their\n",
    "front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged\n",
    "forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the\n",
    "ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further\n",
    "and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully\n",
    "champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on\n",
    "all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden\n",
    "with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of\n",
    "darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander’s\n",
    "soul.\n",
    "\n",
    "So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently\n",
    "guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that\n",
    "interval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the\n",
    "madness, the ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend\n",
    "shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at\n",
    "last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to\n",
    "that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a\n",
    "midnight helm.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)\n",
    "thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was\n",
    "horribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller\n",
    "smote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of\n",
    "sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were\n",
    "open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and\n",
    "mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all\n",
    "this, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed\n",
    "but a minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle\n",
    "lamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and\n",
    "then made ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression,\n",
    "that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to\n",
    "any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered\n",
    "feeling, as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the\n",
    "tiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in\n",
    "some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me?\n",

    "\n",
    "Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off\n",
    "descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,\n",
    "and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed\n",
    "alongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the\n",
    "headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his\n",
    "great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in\n",
    "due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and\n",
    "Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the\n",
    "fire;—but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of\n",
    "the description by rehearsing—singing, if I may—the romantic proceeding\n",
    "of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the\n",
    "hold, where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities,\n",
    "sliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to\n",
    "rise and blow.\n",
    "\n",
    "While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the\n",
    "six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling\n",
    "this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed\n",
    "round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot\n",
    "across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last\n",
    "man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,\n",
    "rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, _ex officio_,\n",
    "every sailor is a cooper.\n",
    "\n",
    "At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the\n",
    "great hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,\n",
    "and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the\n",
    "hatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable\n",
    "incidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream\n",
    "with freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous\n",
    "masses of the whale’s head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie\n",
    "about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted\n",
    "all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the\n",
    "entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din\n",
    "is deafening.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this\n",
    "self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,\n",
    "you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a\n",
    "most scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil\n",
    "possesses a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the\n",
    "decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of\n",
    "oil. Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a\n",
    "potent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back\n",
    "of the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly\n",
    "exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with\n",
    "buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot\n",
    "is brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous implements which\n",
    "have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. The\n",
    "great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works, completely\n",
    "hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in\n",
    "unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of\n",
    "almost the entire ship’s company, the whole of this conscientious duty\n",
    "is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own\n",
    "ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the\n",
    "immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from\n",
    "out the daintiest Holland.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and\n",
    "humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;\n",
    "propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not\n",
    "to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to\n",
    "such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short\n",

    "somewhere. Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest\n",
    "uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing straight through\n",
    "for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their\n",
    "wrists with all day rowing on the Line,—they only step to the deck to\n",
    "carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash,\n",
    "yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the\n",
    "combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works;\n",
    "when, on the heel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves\n",
    "to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the\n",

    "are startled by the cry of “There she blows!” and away they fly to\n",

    "friends, but this is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we\n",
    "mortals by long toilings extracted from this world’s vast bulk its\n",
    "small but valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed\n",

    "Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,\n",

    "the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been\n",
    "added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,\n",
    "he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely\n",
    "eyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the\n",
    "binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the\n",
    "compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of\n",
    "his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the\n",
    "mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted\n",
    "gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only\n",
    "dashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly\n",
    "attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as\n",
    "though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in\n",
    "some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some\n",
    "certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little\n",
    "worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell\n",
    "by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass\n",
    "in the Milky Way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of\n",
    "the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands,\n",
    "the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst\n",
    "all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes,\n",
    "yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its\n",
    "Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour\n",
    "passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with\n",
    "thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless\n",
    "every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it\n",
    "was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however\n",
    "wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as\n",
    "the white whale’s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary\n",

    "would ever live to spend it.\n",

    "Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun\n",
    "and tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s\n",
    "disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving,\n",
    "are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems\n",
    "almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by\n",
    "passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.\n",

    "unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the\n",
    "likeness of three Andes’ summits; from one a flame; a tower on another;\n",
    "on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of\n",

    "The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?”\n",
    "\n",
    "So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,\n",
    "bearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was\n",
    "standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to\n",
    "the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat’s\n",
    "bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of\n",
    "sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round\n",
    "him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket\n",
    "streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar’s surcoat.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Hast seen the White Whale?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,\n",
    "he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden\n",
    "head like a mallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near\n",
    "him—“Stand by to lower!”\n",
    "\n",
    "In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\n",
    "crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the\n",
    "stranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the\n",
    "excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his\n",
    "leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his\n",
    "own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical\n",
    "contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and\n",
    "shipped in any other vessel at a moment’s warning. Now, it is no very\n",
    "easy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it,\n",
    "like whalemen—to clamber up a ship’s side from a boat on the open sea;\n",
    "for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,\n",
    "and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So,\n",
    "deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether\n",
    "unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly\n",
    "reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain\n",
    "changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\n",
    "circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\n",
    "luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And\n",
    "in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the\n",
    "two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\n",
    "perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a\n",
    "pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem\n",
    "to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to\n",
    "use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,\n",
    "because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,\n",
    "cried out, “I see, I see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing\n",
    "over the cutting-tackle.”\n",
    "\n",
    "As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\n",
    "previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive\n",
    "curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.\n",
    "This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,\n",
    "slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting\n",
    "in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then\n",
    "giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to\n",
    "hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running\n",
    "parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high\n",
    "bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm\n",
    "frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab,\n",
    "putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two\n",
    "sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let\n",
    "us shake bones together!—an arm and a leg!—an arm that never can\n",
    "shrink, d’ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did’st thou see\n",
    "the White Whale?—how long ago?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards\n",
    "the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a\n",
    "telescope; “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from\n",
    "the capstan, and resting on the Englishman’s shoulder, as he did so.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,”\n",
    "began the Englishman. “I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.\n",
    "Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat\n",
    "fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went\n",
    "milling and milling round so, that my boat’s crew could only trim dish,\n",
    "by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches\n",
    "from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white\n",
    "head and hump, all crows’ feet and wrinkles.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended\n",
    "breath.\n",
    "\n",
    "“And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, aye—they were mine—_my_ irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but on!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly. “Well,\n",
    "this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all\n",
    "afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old trick—I know\n",
    "him.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“How it was exactly,” continued the one-armed commander, “I do not\n",
    "know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there\n",
    "somehow; but we didn’t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled\n",
    "on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other\n",
    "whale’s; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters\n",
    "stood, and what a noble great whale it was—the noblest and biggest I\n",
    "ever saw, sir, in my life—I resolved to capture him, spite of the\n",
    "boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would\n",
    "get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a\n",
    "devil of a boat’s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I\n",
    "say, I jumped into my first mate’s boat—Mr. Mounttop’s here (by the\n",
    "way, Captain—Mounttop; Mounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped\n",
    "into Mounttop’s boat, which, d’ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with\n",
    "mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old\n",
    "great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts and souls\n",
    "alive, man—the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes\n",
    "out—all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale’s tail\n",
    "looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble\n",
    "steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday,\n",
    "with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after\n",
    "the second iron, to toss it overboard—down comes the tail like a Lima\n",
    "tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,\n",
    "flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was\n",
    "all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I\n",
    "seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung\n",
    "to that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at\n",
    "the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down\n",
    "like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near\n",
    "me caught me here” (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); “yes,\n",
    "caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell’s flames, I was\n",
    "thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb\n",
    "ript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole length of my\n",
    "arm—came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and that gentleman there\n",
    "will tell you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr. Bunger, ship’s surgeon:\n",
    "Bunger, my lad,—the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the\n",

    "\n",
    "The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all\n",
    "the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote\n",
    "his gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but\n",
    "sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and\n",
    "patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between\n",
    "a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,\n",
    "occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two\n",
    "crippled captains. But, at his superior’s introduction of him to Ahab,\n",
    "he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain’s bidding.\n",

    "advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”\n",

    "\n",
    "“Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing\n",
    "hot weather there on the Line. But it was no use—I did all I could; sat\n",
    "up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh, very severe!” chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly\n",
    "altering his voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till\n",
    "he couldn’t see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half\n",
    "seas over, about three o’clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up\n",
    "with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher,\n",
    "and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh\n",
    "out! why don’t ye? You know you’re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave\n",

    "man.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—said the\n",
    "imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab—“is apt to\n",
    "be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But\n",
    "I may as well say—en passant, as the French remark—that I myself—that\n",
    "is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy—am a strict total\n",
    "abstinence man; I never drink—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Water!” cried the captain; “he never drinks it; it’s a sort of fits to\n",
    "him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on with\n",
    "the arm story.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yes, I may as well,” said the surgeon, coolly. “I was about observing,\n",
    "sir, before Captain Boomer’s facetious interruption, that spite of my\n",
    "best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse;\n",
    "the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw;\n",
    "more than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead\n",
    "line. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it\n",
    "came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is\n",
    "against all rule”—pointing at it with the marlingspike—“that is the\n",
    "captain’s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had\n",
    "that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one’s brains out\n",
    "with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical\n",
    "passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir”—removing his hat, and\n",
    "brushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,\n",
    "but which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever\n",
    "having been a wound—“Well, the captain there will tell you how that\n",
    "came here; he knows.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“No, I don’t,” said the captain, “but his mother did; he was born with\n",
    "it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever such another\n",
    "Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in\n",
    "pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.”\n",

    "\n",
    "“Oh!” cried the one-armed captain, “oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we\n",
    "didn’t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I\n",
    "didn’t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,\n",
    "till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about\n",
    "Moby Dick—as some call him—and then I knew it was he.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Did’st thou cross his wake again?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Twice.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“But could not fasten?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Didn’t want to try to: ain’t one limb enough? What should I do without\n",

    "swallows.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well, then,” interrupted Bunger, “give him your left arm for bait to\n",
    "get the right. Do you know, gentlemen”—very gravely and mathematically\n",
    "bowing to each Captain in succession—“Do you know, gentlemen, that the\n",
    "digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine\n",
    "Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest\n",
    "even a man’s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the\n",
    "White Whale’s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to\n",
    "swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But\n",
    "sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of\n",
    "mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a\n",
    "time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a\n",
    "twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in\n",
    "small tacks, d’ye see. No possible way for him to digest that\n",
    "jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system.\n",
    "Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind\n",
    "to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial\n",
    "to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale\n",
    "have another chance at you shortly, that’s all.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“No, thank ye, Bunger,” said the English Captain, “he’s welcome to the\n",
    "arm he has, since I can’t help it, and didn’t know him then; but not to\n",
    "another one. No more White Whales for me; I’ve lowered for him once,\n",
    "and that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I\n",
    "know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark\n",
    "ye, he’s best let alone; don’t you think so, Captain?”—glancing at the\n",
    "ivory leg.\n",
    "\n",
    "“He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let\n",
    "alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He’s all a\n",

    "\n",
    "“Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend’s,” cried Bunger, stoopingly\n",

    "blood—bring the thermometer!—it’s at the boiling point!—his pulse makes\n",
    "these planks beat!—sir!”—taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing\n",
    "near to Ahab’s arm.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a moment he was standing in the boat’s stern, and the Manilla men\n",

    "Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she\n",
    "hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,\n",
    "merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of\n",
    "Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman’s opinion, comes not\n",
    "far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point\n",
    "of real historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord\n",
    "1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous\n",
    "fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out\n",
    "the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;\n",
    "though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant\n",
    "Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets\n",
    "pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not\n",
    "elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were\n",
    "the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm\n",
    "Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the\n",
    "whole globe who so harpooned him.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,\n",
    "and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape\n",
    "Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any\n",
    "sort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one;\n",
    "and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm,\n",
    "the Amelia’s example was soon followed by other ships, English and\n",
    "American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were\n",
    "thrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable\n",
    "house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons—how many, their\n",
    "mother only knows—and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I\n",
    "think, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the\n",
    "sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South\n",
    "Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling\n",
    "voyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this\n",
    "is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship\n",
    "of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.\n",
    "That ship—well called the “Syren”—made a noble experimental cruise; and\n",
    "it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became\n",

    "forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps—every\n",
    "soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine\n",
    "gam I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his\n",
    "ivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that\n",
    "ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever\n",
    "lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it\n",
    "at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s\n",
    "squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands—visitors and all—were\n",
    "called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each\n",
    "other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our\n",
    "jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the\n",
    "howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts\n",
    "did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that\n",
    "we had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting\n",
    "down the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to\n",
    "my taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was\n",
    "bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for\n",
    "certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,\n",
    "symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that\n",
    "you could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were\n",
    "swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their\n",
    "pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread—but that couldn’t be\n",
    "helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread\n",
    "contained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very\n",
    "light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you\n",
    "ate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the\n",
    "dimensions of the cook’s boilers, including his own live parchment\n",
    "boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of\n",
    "good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and\n",
    "capital from boot heels to hat-band.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other\n",
    "English whalers I know of—not all though—were such famous, hospitable\n",
    "ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the\n",
    "joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I\n",
    "will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is\n",
    "matter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of\n",
    "historical whale research, when it has seemed needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,\n",
    "Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant\n",
    "in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching\n",
    "plenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English\n",
    "merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence,\n",
    "in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and\n",
    "natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some\n",
    "special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further\n",
    "elucidated.\n",
    "\n",
    "During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an\n",
    "ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew\n",
    "must be about whalers. The title was, “Dan Coopman,” wherefore I\n",
    "concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam\n",
    "cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was\n",
    "reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one\n",
    "“Fitz Swackhammer.” But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,\n",
    "professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus\n",
    "and St. Pott’s, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a\n",
    "box of sperm candles for his trouble—this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as\n",
    "he spied the book, assured me that “Dan Coopman” did not mean “The\n",
    "Cooper,” but “The Merchant.” In short, this ancient and learned Low\n",
    "Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other\n",
    "subjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery.\n",
    "And in this chapter it was, headed, “Smeer,” or “Fat,” that I found a\n",
    "long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180\n",
    "sail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead,\n",
    "I transcribe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock\n",
    "fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins\n",
    "of butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese\n",
    "(probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of\n",
    "beer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in\n",
    "the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole\n",
    "pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this\n",
    "beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were\n",
    "incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic\n",
    "application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my\n",
    "own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by\n",
    "every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen\n",
    "whale fishery. In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and\n",
    "Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their\n",
    "naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the\n",
    "nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game\n",
    "in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux\n",
    "country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of\n",
    "train oil.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those\n",
    "polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that\n",
    "climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,\n",
    "including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not\n",
    "much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their\n",
    "fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I\n",
    "say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks’\n",
    "allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.\n",
    "Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might\n",
    "fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a\n",
    "boat’s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem\n",
    "somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But\n",
    "this was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with\n",
    "the constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would\n",
    "be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his\n",
    "boat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.\n",
    "\n",
    "But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of\n",
    "two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English\n",
    "whalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when\n",
    "cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the\n",
    "world, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the\n",
    "decanter.\n",

    "Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly\n",
    "dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail\n",
    "upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough\n",
    "sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still\n",
    "further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters,\n",

    "But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the\n",
    "fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the\n",

    "on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a\n",

    "\n",
    "I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far\n",
    "beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed\n",
    "with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged\n",
    "to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his\n",

    "heads of the lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my\n",
    "boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the\n",
    "contents of that young cub?\n",
    "\n",
    "And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their\n",
    "gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted\n",
    "to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides.\n",
    "For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey\n",
    "of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with\n",
    "the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side\n",
    "glen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his\n",
    "capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted\n",
    "with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought\n",
    "together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his\n",
    "people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,\n",
    "chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and\n",
    "all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the\n",
    "wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an\n",
    "unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his\n",
    "head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings\n",
    "seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of\n",
    "its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,\n",
    "then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where\n",
    "a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebræ were carved with\n",
    "Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests\n",
    "kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again\n",
    "sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the\n",
    "terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung\n",
    "sword that so affrighted Damocles.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen;\n",
    "the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the\n",
    "industrious earth beneath was as a weaver’s loom, with a gorgeous\n",
    "carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and\n",
    "woof, and the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their\n",
    "laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the\n",
    "message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the\n",
    "lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving\n",
    "the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!—pause!—one\n",
    "word!—whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all\n",
    "these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!—stay thy hand!—but one single\n",
    "word with thee! Nay—the shuttle flies—the figures float from forth the\n",
    "loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god,\n",
    "he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal\n",
    "voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened;\n",
    "and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak\n",
    "through it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken\n",
    "words that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words\n",
    "are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened\n",
    "casements. Thereby have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be\n",
    "heedful; for so, in all this din of the great world’s loom, thy\n",
    "subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the\n",
    "great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler! Yet,\n",
    "as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around\n",
    "him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over\n",
    "with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but\n",
    "himself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim\n",
    "god wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the\n",
    "skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real\n",
    "jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an\n",
    "object of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests\n",
    "should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced\n",
    "before this skeleton—brushed the vines aside—broke through the ribs—and\n",
    "with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many\n",
    "winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was out; and\n",
    "following it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered. I saw no\n",
    "living thing within; naught was there but bones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the\n",
    "skeleton. From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me\n",
    "taking the altitude of the final rib, “How now!” they shouted; “Dar’st\n",
    "thou measure this our god! That’s for us.” “Aye, priests—well, how long\n",
    "do ye make him, then?” But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them,\n",
    "concerning feet and inches; they cracked each other’s sconces with\n",
    "their yard-sticks—the great skull echoed—and seizing that lucky chance,\n",
    "I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it\n",
    "recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied\n",
    "measurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can\n",
    "refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell\n",
    "me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where\n",
    "they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise,\n",
    "I have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they\n",
    "have what the proprietors call “the only perfect specimen of a\n",
    "Greenland or River Whale in the United States.” Moreover, at a place in\n",
    "Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford\n",
    "Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of\n",
    "moderate size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend\n",
    "King Tranquo’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons\n",
    "belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar\n",
    "grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir\n",
    "Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir\n",
    "Clifford’s whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great\n",
    "chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony\n",
    "cavities—spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan—and swing all day upon\n",
    "his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and\n",
    "shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of\n",
    "keys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep\n",
    "at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the\n",
    "echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled\n",
    "view from his forehead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied\n",
    "verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild\n",
    "wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving\n",
    "such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished\n",
    "the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then\n",
    "composing—at least, what untattooed parts might remain—I did not\n",
    "trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all\n",
    "enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.\n",

    "CHAPTER 103. Measurement of The Whale’s Skeleton.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain\n",
    "statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton\n",
    "we are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base\n",
    "upon Captain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized\n",
    "Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful\n",
    "calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between\n",
    "eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty\n",
    "feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least\n",
    "ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would\n",
    "considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one\n",
    "thousand one hundred inhabitants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to\n",
    "this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman’s imagination?\n",
    "\n",
    "Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,\n",
    "jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now\n",
    "simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\n",
    "unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a\n",
    "proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the\n",
    "most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it\n",
    "in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under\n",
    "your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion\n",
    "of the general structure we are about to view.\n",
    "\n",
    "In length, the Sperm Whale’s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\n",
    "feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\n",
    "been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\n",
    "fifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two\n",
    "feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty\n",
    "feet of plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less\n",
    "than a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs\n",
    "which once enclosed his vitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\n",
    "extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\n",
    "the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\n",
    "twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\n",
    "for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was\n",
    "nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\n",
    "successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\n",
    "of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From\n",
    "that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only\n",
    "spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore\n",
    "a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most\n",
    "arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay\n",
    "footpath bridges over small streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\n",
    "circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of\n",
    "the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of\n",
    "the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the\n",
    "fish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of\n",
    "the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least\n",
    "sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more\n",
    "than eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion\n",
    "of the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I\n",
    "now saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with\n",
    "tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for\n",
    "the ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of\n",
    "the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\n",
    "\n",
    "How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try\n",
    "to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his\n",
    "dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in\n",
    "the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his\n",
    "angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully\n",
    "invested whale be truly and livingly found out.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\n",
    "crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now\n",
    "it’s done, it looks much like Pompey’s Pillar.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are forty and odd vertebræ in all, which in the skeleton are not\n",
    "locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a\n",
    "Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a\n",
    "middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth\n",
    "more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the\n",
    "tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white\n",
    "billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they\n",
    "had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest’s children,\n",
    "who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the\n",
    "spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into\n",
    "simple child’s play.\n",

    "Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from\n",
    "the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,\n",
    "in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the\n",
    "original bulk of his sires.\n",
    "\n",
    "But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the\n",
    "present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are\n",
    "found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period\n",
    "prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those\n",
    "belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier\n",
    "ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the\n",
    "Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than\n",
    "seventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen,\n",
    "that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a\n",

    "But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an\n",
    "advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may\n",
    "it not be, that since Adam’s time they have degenerated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of\n",
    "such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For\n",
    "Pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and\n",

    "Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and\n",
    "Solander, Cooke’s naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy\n",
    "of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or\n",
    "Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three\n",
    "hundred and sixty feet. And Lacépède, the French naturalist, in his\n",
    "elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page\n",
    "3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and\n",
    "twenty-eight feet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.\n",
    "\n",
    "But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is\n",

    "that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not\n",
    "measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks;\n",
    "and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest\n",
    "Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they\n",
    "are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize\n",

    "fattest of Pharaoh’s fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not\n",

    "But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more\n",

    "look-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even\n",
    "through Behring’s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and\n",
    "lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along\n",
    "all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long\n",
    "endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not\n",

    "were, could be statistically stated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the\n",
    "gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former\n",
    "years (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in\n",
    "small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in\n",
    "consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more\n",
    "remunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,\n",
    "influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense\n",
    "caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes,\n",
    "and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but\n",
    "widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally\n",
    "fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone\n",
    "whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with\n",
    "them, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being\n",

    "Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two\n",
    "firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain\n",
    "impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty\n",
    "Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas\n",

    "to their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers\n",
    "and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed\n",

    "But though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than\n",
    "13,000, have been annually slain on the nor’ west coast by the\n",
    "Americans alone; yet there are considerations which render even this\n",

    "King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are\n",
    "numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems\n",

    "\n",
    "Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of\n",
    "whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,\n",

    "\n",
    "The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel\n",
    "Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to\n",
    "his own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his\n",
    "boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when\n",
    "after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so\n",
    "vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it\n",
    "was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough);\n",
    "then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and\n",
    "wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances\n",
    "lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his\n",
    "pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the\n",
    "condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not\n",
    "been very long prior to the Pequod’s sailing from Nantucket, that he\n",
    "had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible;\n",
    "by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his\n",
    "ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise\n",
    "smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme\n",
    "difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all\n",
    "the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of\n",
    "a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most\n",
    "poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as\n",
    "the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity,\n",
    "all miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than\n",
    "equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief\n",
    "go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of\n",
    "this: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that\n",
    "while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them\n",
    "for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the\n",
    "joy-childlessness of all hell’s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal\n",
    "miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally\n",
    "progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of\n",
    "this, there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the\n",
    "thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly felicities\n",
    "ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at\n",
    "bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an\n",
    "archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the\n",
    "obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal\n",
    "miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the\n",
    "gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft\n",
    "cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that\n",
    "the gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad\n",

    "why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the\n",
    "sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such\n",
    "Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought\n",
    "speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.\n",
    "Captain Peleg’s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means\n",
    "adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab’s deeper part, every\n",
    "revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory\n",
    "light. But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least.\n",
    "That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness. And\n",
    "not only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore,\n",
    "who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less banned approach\n",

    "did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab—invested itself with terrors, not\n",
    "entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails. So that,\n",
    "through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as in them\n",
    "lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it\n",
    "was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it\n",

    "supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which\n",
    "had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful\n",
    "selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured.\n",
    "This done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that\n",
    "night; and to provide all the fittings for it, independent of those\n",
    "pertaining to the distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship’s forge was\n",
    "ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and,\n",
    "to accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at\n",
    "once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high\n",
    "abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But\n",
    "from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they\n",
    "seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.\n",
    "But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of\n",
    "the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod’s carpenter was no duplicate;\n",
    "hence, he now comes in person on this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging\n",
    "to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,\n",
    "alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his\n",
    "own; the carpenter’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk\n",
    "of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with\n",
    "wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of\n",
    "the generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly\n",
    "efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually\n",
    "recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years’ voyage, in\n",
    "uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in\n",
    "ordinary duties:—repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the\n",
    "shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull’s eyes in the deck, or new\n",
    "tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more\n",
    "directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover\n",
    "unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both\n",
    "useful and capricious.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,\n",
    "was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several\n",
    "vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times\n",
    "except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed\n",
    "athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.\n",
    "\n",
    "A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:\n",
    "the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and\n",
    "straightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage\n",
    "strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of\n",
    "right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter\n",
    "makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the\n",
    "carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars\n",
    "to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his\n",
    "big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the\n",
    "constellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the\n",
    "carpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out\n",
    "pincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there;\n",
    "but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded\n",
    "operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter\n",
    "signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent\n",
    "and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he\n",
    "deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But\n",
    "while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with\n",
    "such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue\n",
    "some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For\n",
    "nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal\n",
    "stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the\n",
    "surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general\n",
    "stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while\n",
    "pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace,\n",
    "and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was\n",
    "this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an\n",
    "all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an\n",
    "old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked\n",
    "now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have\n",
    "served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded\n",
    "forecastle of Noah’s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a\n",
    "life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had\n",
    "gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small\n",
    "outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a\n",
    "stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born\n",
    "babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.\n",
    "You might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him\n",
    "involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did\n",
    "not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he\n",
    "had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or\n",
    "uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal\n",
    "process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one,\n",
    "must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was\n",
    "like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, _multum in\n",
    "parvo_, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior—though a little\n",
    "swelled—of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of\n",
    "various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,\n",
    "pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted\n",
    "to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open\n",
    "that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him\n",
    "up by the legs, and there they were.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,\n",
    "was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a\n",
    "common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously\n",
    "did its duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few\n",
    "drops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it\n",
    "had abided for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same\n",
    "unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept\n",
    "him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an\n",
    "unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his\n",
    "body was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking\n",
    "all the time to keep himself awake.\n",

    "Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;\n",
    "dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the\n",
    "higher you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as\n",

    "Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should\n",
    "have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where,\n",
    "stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about\n",
    "amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom\n",
    "of a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor\n",
    "pagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he\n",
    "caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after\n",
    "some days’ suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill\n",

    "long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his\n",
    "frame and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his\n",
    "cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller\n",
    "and fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but\n",
    "deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony\n",
    "to that immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And\n",
    "like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his\n",
    "eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe\n",
    "that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of\n",
    "this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any\n",

    "higher towards his destined heaven.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,\n",
    "what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he\n",
    "asked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was\n",
    "just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had\n",
    "chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich\n",
    "war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all\n",
    "whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes,\n",
    "and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was\n",
    "not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead\n",
    "warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated\n",
    "away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the\n",
    "stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own\n",
    "mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form\n",
    "the white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the\n",
    "thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual\n",
    "sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.\n",
    "No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial\n",
    "to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes\n",
    "were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and\n",
    "much lee-way adown the dim ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter\n",
    "was at once commanded to do Queequeg’s bidding, whatever it might\n",
    "include. There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard,\n",
    "which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal\n",
    "groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin\n",
    "was recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the\n",
    "order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent\n",
    "promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took\n",
    "Queequeg’s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg’s\n",
    "person as he shifted the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ah! poor fellow! he’ll have to die now,” ejaculated the Long Island\n",
    "sailor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general\n",
    "reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the\n",
    "coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two\n",
    "notches at its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his\n",
    "tools, and to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he\n",
    "lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring\n",
    "whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people\n",
    "on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one’s\n",
    "consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to\n",
    "him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some\n",
    "dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will\n",
    "shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be\n",
    "indulged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an\n",
    "attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock\n",
    "drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along\n",
    "with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also,\n",
    "biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh\n",
    "water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up\n",
    "in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for\n",
    "a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that\n",
    "he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without\n",
    "moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his\n",
    "little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo\n",
    "between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed\n",
    "over him. The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay\n",
    "Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in\n",
    "view. “Rarmai” (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and\n",
    "signed to be replaced in his hammock.\n",
    "\n",
    "But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all\n",
    "this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took\n",
    "him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where\n",
    "go ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where\n",
    "the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little\n",
    "errand for me? Seek out one Pip, who’s now been missing long: I think\n",
    "he’s in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he\n",
    "must be very sad; for look! he’s left his tambourine behind;—I found\n",
    "it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I’ll beat ye your\n",
    "dying march.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I have heard,” murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, “that in\n",
    "violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and\n",
    "that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their\n",
    "wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken\n",
    "in their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor\n",
    "Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers\n",
    "of all our heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?—Hark! he\n",
    "speaks again: but more wildly now.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Form two and two! Let’s make a General of him! Ho, where’s his\n",

    "cock now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!—mind ye\n",
    "that; Queequeg dies game!—take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies\n",
    "game! I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward;\n",
    "died all a’shiver;—out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the\n",
    "Antilles he’s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he\n",

    "and hail him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame\n",
    "upon all cowards—shame upon them! Let ’em go drown like Pip, that\n",
    "jumped from a whale-boat. Shame! shame!”\n",
    "\n",
    "During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip\n",
    "was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now\n",
    "that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon\n",
    "there seemed no need of the carpenter’s box: and thereupon, when some\n",
    "expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the\n",
    "cause of his sudden convalescence was this;—at a critical moment, he\n",
    "had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;\n",
    "and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,\n",
    "he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter\n",
    "of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a\n",
    "word, it was Queequeg’s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to\n",
    "live, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale,\n",
    "or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;\n",
    "that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing,\n",
    "generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day.\n",
    "So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after\n",
    "sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a\n",
    "vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms\n",
    "and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then\n",
    "springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,\n",
    "pronounced himself fit for a fight.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and\n",
    "emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.\n",
    "Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of\n",
    "grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was\n",
    "striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on\n",
    "his body. And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet\n",
    "and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written\n",
    "out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a\n",
    "mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in\n",
    "his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one\n",
    "volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own\n",
    "live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore\n",
    "destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon\n",
    "they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last. And this thought\n",
    "it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his,\n",

    "for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith’s shop was\n",
    "in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so\n",
    "that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no\n",
    "unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing\n",
    "of her young-armed old husband’s hammer; whose reverberations, muffled\n",

    "\n",
    "With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about\n",
    "mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter\n",
    "placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the\n",
    "coals, and with the other at his forge’s lungs, when Captain Ahab came\n",
    "along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While\n",
    "yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last,\n",
    "Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the\n",
    "anvil—the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights,\n",
    "some of which flew close to Ahab.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Are these thy Mother Carey’s chickens, Perth? they are always flying\n",
    "in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;—look here, they\n",
    "burn; but thou—thou liv’st among them without a scorch.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,” answered Perth, resting\n",
    "for a moment on his hammer; “I am past scorching; not easily can’st\n",
    "thou scorch a scar.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful\n",
    "to me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others\n",
    "that is not mad. Thou should’st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou\n",
    "not go mad? How can’st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens\n",
    "yet hate thee, that thou can’st not go mad?—What wert thou making\n",
    "there?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“And can’st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard\n",
    "usage as it had?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think so, sir.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“And I suppose thou can’st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never\n",
    "mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Look ye here, then,” cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning\n",
    "with both hands on Perth’s shoulders; “look ye here—_here_—can ye\n",
    "smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,” sweeping one hand across his\n",
    "ribbed brow; “if thou could’st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my\n",
    "head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.\n",
    "Answer! Can’st thou smoothe this seam?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for\n",
    "though thou only see’st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into\n",
    "the bone of my skull—_that_ is all wrinkles! But, away with child’s\n",
    "play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!” jingling the\n",
    "leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. “I, too, want a harpoon\n",
    "made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth;\n",
    "something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There’s the\n",
    "stuff,” flinging the pouch upon the anvil. “Look ye, blacksmith, these\n",
    "are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the\n",
    "best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the\n",
    "melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me\n",
    "first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer\n",
    "these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick!\n",
    "I’ll blow the fire.”\n",
    "\n",
    "When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by\n",
    "spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. “A\n",
    "flaw!” rejecting the last one. “Work that over again, Perth.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when\n",
    "Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then,\n",
    "with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to\n",
    "him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge\n",
    "shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and\n",
    "bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or\n",
    "some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What’s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?” muttered\n",
    "Stubb, looking on from the forecastle. “That Parsee smells fire like a\n",
    "fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket’s powder-pan.”\n",
    "\n",
    "At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as\n",
    "Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near\n",
    "by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab’s bent face.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Would’st thou brand me, Perth?” wincing for a moment with the pain;\n",
    "“have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this\n",
    "harpoon for the White Whale?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them\n",
    "thyself, man. Here are my razors—the best of steel; here, and make the\n",
    "barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.”\n",
    "\n",
    "For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would\n",
    "fain not use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup,\n",
    "nor pray till—but here—to work!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the\n",
    "shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the\n",
    "blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to\n",
    "tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.\n",
    "\n",
    "“No, no—no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,\n",
    "there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me\n",
    "as much blood as will cover this barb?” holding it high up. A cluster\n",
    "of dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen\n",
    "flesh, and the White Whale’s barbs were then tempered.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!”\n",
    "deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the\n",
    "baptismal blood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of\n",
    "hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the\n",
    "socket of the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some\n",
    "fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension.\n",
    "Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string,\n",
    "then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed,\n",
    "“Good! and now for the seizings.”\n",
    "\n",
    "At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns\n",
    "were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole\n",
    "was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope\n",
    "was traced half-way along the pole’s length, and firmly secured so,\n",
    "with intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope—like the\n",
    "Three Fates—remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with\n",
    "the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory\n",
    "pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his\n",
    "cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was\n",
    "heard. Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy\n",
    "strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the\n",
    "melancholy ship, and mocked it!\n",

    "\n",
    "Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising\n",
    "ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,\n",
    "pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on\n",
    "the stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or\n",
    "sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or\n",
    "seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small\n",
    "success for their pains.\n",
    "\n",
    "At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow\n",
    "heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so\n",
    "sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone\n",
    "cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy\n",
    "quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the\n",
    "ocean’s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and\n",
    "would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a\n",
    "remorseless fang.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a\n",
    "certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he\n",
    "regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing\n",
    "only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high\n",
    "rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when\n",
    "the western emigrants’ horses only show their erected ears, while their\n",
    "hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these\n",
    "there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied\n",
    "children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when\n",
    "the flowers of the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most\n",
    "mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate,\n",
    "and form one seamless whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as\n",
    "temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem\n",
    "to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath\n",
    "upon them prove but tarnishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in\n",
    "ye,—though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,—in ye,\n",
    "men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some\n",
    "few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them.\n",
    "Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling\n",
    "threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a\n",
    "storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this\n",
    "life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one\n",
    "pause:—through infancy’s unconscious spell, boyhood’s thoughtless\n",
    "faith, adolescence’ doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then\n",
    "disbelief, resting at last in manhood’s pondering repose of If. But\n",
    "once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and\n",
    "men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor\n",
    "no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will\n",
    "never weary? Where is the foundling’s father hidden? Our souls are like\n",
    "those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of\n",
    "our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat’s side into that\n",
    "same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—\n",
    "\n",
    "“Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride’s\n",
    "eye!—Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping\n",
    "cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep\n",
    "down and do believe.”\n",
    "\n",
    "And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same\n",
    "golden light:—\n",

    "CHAPTER 115. The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.\n",
    "\n",
    "And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down\n",
    "before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab’s harpoon had been welded.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her\n",
    "last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in\n",
    "glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,\n",
    "sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous\n",
    "to pointing her prow for home.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red\n",
    "bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,\n",
    "bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long\n",
    "lower jaw of the last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks\n",
    "of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways\n",
    "lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm;\n",
    "above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of\n",
    "the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen\n",
    "lamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most\n",
    "surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in\n",
    "the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without\n",
    "securing a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been\n",
    "given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional\n",
    "supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met;\n",
    "and these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain’s and\n",
    "officers’ state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked\n",
    "into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an\n",
    "oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the\n",
    "forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests,\n",
    "and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a\n",
    "head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged\n",
    "his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the\n",
    "sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was\n",
    "filled with sperm, except the captain’s pantaloons pockets, and those\n",
    "he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of\n",
    "his entire satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the\n",
    "barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing\n",
    "still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge\n",
    "try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like _poke_ or stomach skin\n",
    "of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the\n",
    "clenched hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and\n",
    "harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with\n",
    "them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,\n",
    "firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long\n",
    "Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were\n",
    "presiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship’s\n",
    "company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from\n",
    "which the huge pots had been removed. You would have almost thought\n",
    "they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they\n",
    "raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the\n",
    "sea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the\n",
    "ship’s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was\n",
    "full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual\n",
    "diversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,\n",
    "with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other’s\n",
    "wakes—one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings\n",
    "as to things to come—their two captains in themselves impersonated the\n",
    "whole striking contrast of the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Come aboard, come aboard!” cried the gay Bachelor’s commander, lifting\n",
    "a glass and a bottle in the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Hast seen the White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "“No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” said the\n",
    "other good-humoredly. “Come aboard!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but come aboard, old\n",
    "hearty, come along. I’ll soon take that black from your brow. Come\n",
    "along, will ye (merry’s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; then aloud, “Thou art\n",
    "a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an\n",
    "empty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward\n",
    "there! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!”\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other\n",
    "stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew\n",
    "of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the\n",
    "receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor’s men never heeding their gaze for\n",
    "the lively revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the\n",
    "taffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a\n",
    "small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed\n",
    "thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was\n",
    "filled with Nantucket soundings.\n",

    "Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune’s favourites\n",
    "sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the\n",
    "rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed\n",
    "it with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor,\n",
    "whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the\n",
    "crimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky,\n",
    "sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and\n",
    "such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy\n",
    "air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent\n",
    "valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned\n",

    "Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned\n",

    "whales dying—the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring—that\n",
    "strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab\n",
    "conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.\n",
    "\n",
    "“He turns and turns him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly, his\n",
    "homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too\n",
    "worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!—Oh\n",
    "that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights.\n",
    "Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in\n",
    "these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks\n",
    "furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still\n",
    "rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the\n",
    "Niger’s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith;\n",

    "CHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,\n",
    "coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would\n",
    "ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to\n",
    "the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed\n",
    "on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship’s\n",
    "prow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon\n",
    "high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was\n",
    "about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his\n",
    "latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of\n",
    "effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing\n",
    "focus of the glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks\n",
    "lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this\n",
    "nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of\n",
    "God’s throne. Well that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished with coloured\n",
    "glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging\n",
    "his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his\n",
    "astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that\n",
    "posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun\n",
    "should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention\n",
    "was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck,\n",
    "and with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with him;\n",
    "only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was\n",
    "subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired\n",
    "observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab\n",
    "soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then\n",
    "falling into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and\n",
    "murmured to himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou\n",
    "tellest me truly where I _am_—but canst thou cast the least hint where\n",
    "I _shall_ be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is\n",
    "this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be\n",
    "eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now\n",
    "beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding\n",
    "the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its\n",
    "numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:\n",
    "“Foolish toy! babies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,\n",
    "and Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but\n",
    "what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where\n",
    "thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that\n",
    "holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of\n",
    "water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy\n",
    "impotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy;\n",
    "and cursed be all the things that cast man’s eyes aloft to that heaven,\n",
    "whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now\n",
    "scorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth’s horizon\n",
    "are the glances of man’s eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as\n",
    "if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou\n",
    "quadrant!” dashing it to the deck, “no longer will I guide my earthly\n",
    "way by thee; the level ship’s compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by\n",
    "log and by line; _these_ shall conduct me, and show me my place on the\n",
    "sea. Aye,” lighting from the boat to the deck, “thus I trample on thee,\n",
    "thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and\n",
    "destroy thee!”\n",
    "\n",
    "As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and\n",
    "dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a\n",
    "fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed over the\n",
    "mute, motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;\n",
    "while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered\n",
    "together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,\n",
    "shouted out—“To the braces! Up helm!—square in!”\n",
    "\n",
    "In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon\n",
    "her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her\n",
    "long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one\n",
    "sufficient steed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod’s\n",
    "tumultuous way, and Ahab’s also, as he went lurching along the deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full\n",
    "of its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,\n",
    "down, to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of\n",
    "thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye,” cried Stubb, “but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, Mr.\n",

    "\n",
    "Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and\n",
    "bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly\n",
    "ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the\n",

    "Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at\n",

    "disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb\n",

    "lashing of the boats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted\n",
    "to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab’s) did\n",
    "not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling\n",
    "ship’s high teetering side, stove in the boat’s bottom at the stern,\n",
    "and left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.\n",

    "all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward—I see it lightens up\n",
    "there; but not with the lightning.”\n",
    "\n",
    "At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following\n",
    "the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same\n",
    "instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Who’s there?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Old Thunder!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his\n",
    "pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed\n",
    "lances of fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off\n",
    "the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some\n",
    "ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But\n",
    "as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may\n",
    "avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly\n",
    "towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering\n",
    "not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the\n",
    "vessel’s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a\n",
    "ship’s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made\n",
    "in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the\n",
    "chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The rods! the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished\n",
    "to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting\n",
    "flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. “Are they overboard? drop them\n",
    "over, fore and aft. Quick!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the\n",
    "weaker side. Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and\n",
    "Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let\n",
    "them be, sir.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Look aloft!” cried Starbuck. “The corpusants! the corpusants!”\n",
    "\n",
    "All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each\n",
    "tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of\n",
    "the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like\n",
    "three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Blast the boat! let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing\n",
    "sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently\n",
    "jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. “Blast it!”—but slipping\n",
    "backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and\n",
    "immediately shifting his tone he cried—“The corpusants have mercy on us\n",
    "all!”\n",
    "\n",
    "To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of\n",
    "the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses\n",
    "from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething\n",
    "sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when\n",
    "God’s burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His “Mene, Mene,\n",
    "Tekel Upharsin” has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the\n",
    "enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all\n",
    "their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away\n",
    "constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the\n",
    "gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and\n",
    "seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted\n",
    "mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely\n",
    "gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by\n",
    "the preternatural light, Queequeg’s tattooing burned like Satanic blue\n",
    "flames on his body.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more\n",
    "the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment\n",
    "or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one.\n",
    "It was Stubb. “What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not\n",
    "the same in the song.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“No, no, it wasn’t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I\n",
    "hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—have\n",
    "they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s too dark\n",
    "to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign\n",
    "of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be\n",
    "chock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so, all that sperm will\n",
    "work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will\n",
    "yet be as three spermaceti candles—that’s the good promise we saw.”\n",
    "\n",
    "At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb’s face slowly beginning\n",
    "to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!” and once\n",
    "more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled\n",
    "supernaturalness in their pallor.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The corpusants have mercy on us all,” cried Stubb, again.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,\n",
    "the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’s front, but with his head bowed away\n",
    "from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where\n",
    "they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,\n",
    "arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a\n",
    "knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various\n",
    "enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running\n",
    "skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all\n",
    "their eyes upcast.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, aye, men!” cried Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white\n",
    "flame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast\n",
    "links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against\n",
    "it; blood against fire! So.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot\n",
    "upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,\n",
    "he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian\n",
    "once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that\n",
    "to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I\n",
    "now know that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor\n",
    "reverence wilt thou be kind; and e’en for hate thou canst but kill; and\n",
    "all are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless,\n",
    "placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will\n",
    "dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of\n",
    "the personified impersonal, a personality stands here. Though but a\n",
    "point at best; whencesoe’er I came; wheresoe’er I go; yet while I\n",
    "earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal\n",
    "rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of\n",
    "love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere\n",
    "supernal power; and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted\n",
    "worlds, there’s that in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou\n",
    "clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of\n",
    "fire, I breathe it back to thee.”\n",
    "\n",
    "[_Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap\n",
    "lengthwise to thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes\n",
    "his eyes, his right hand pressed hard upon them._]\n",
    "\n",
    "“I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung\n",
    "from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can\n",
    "then grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the\n",
    "homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The\n",
    "lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my\n",
    "whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning\n",
    "ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though\n",
    "thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of\n",
    "light, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?\n",
    "There burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my\n",
    "genealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know\n",
    "not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but\n",
    "thine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself\n",
    "unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself\n",
    "unbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou\n",
    "omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear\n",
    "spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness\n",
    "mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly\n",
    "see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast\n",
    "thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with\n",
    "haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap\n",
    "with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly\n",
    "I worship thee!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahab’s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’s fire, remained firmly lashed\n",
    "in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat’s\n",
    "bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather\n",
    "sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a\n",
    "levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there\n",
    "like a serpent’s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is\n",
    "against thee, old man; forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill\n",
    "continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a\n",
    "fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the\n",
    "braces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast\n",
    "mate’s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But\n",
    "dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the\n",
    "burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to\n",
    "transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope’s end.\n",
    "Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart\n",
    "that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:—\n",
    "\n",
    "“All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and\n",
    "heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye\n",

    "seemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two\n",
    "compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.\n",
    "\n",
    "But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the\n",

    "Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than\n",
    "one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as\n",
    "developed in the mariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one\n",
    "with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much\n",
    "marvelled at, that such things should be. Instances where the lightning\n",
    "has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars\n",
    "and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more\n",
    "fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before\n",
    "magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle.\n",
    "But in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the\n",
    "original virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be\n",
    "affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship;\n",
    "even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed\n",
    "compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took\n",
    "the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were\n",
    "exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship’s course to be\n",
    "changed accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod\n",
    "thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair\n",
    "one had only been juggling her.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said\n",
    "nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and\n",
    "Flask—who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his\n",
    "feelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some\n",
    "of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear\n",
    "of Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost\n",
    "wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain\n",
    "magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But\n",

    "\n",
    "“Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked\n",
    "thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But\n",
    "Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck—a lance without\n",
    "a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker’s needles.\n",
    "Quick!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about\n",
    "to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to\n",
    "revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a\n",
    "matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old\n",
    "man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily\n",
    "practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious\n",
    "sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him\n",
    "the things he had demanded, “my men, the thunder turned old Ahab’s\n",
    "needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own,\n",
    "that will point as true as any.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as\n",
    "this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic\n",
    "might follow. But Starbuck looked away.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the\n",
    "lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade\n",
    "him hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the\n",
    "maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he\n",
    "placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly\n",
    "hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before.\n",
    "Then going through some small strange motions with it—whether\n",
    "indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to\n",
    "augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain—he called for linen thread;\n",
    "and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there,\n",
    "and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of\n",
    "the compass-cards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering\n",
    "and vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when\n",
    "Ahab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly\n",
    "back from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it,\n",
    "exclaimed,—“Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level\n",
    "loadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!”\n",

    "the log; though at the same time, and frequently more for form’s sake\n",

    "hung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he\n",

    "The life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern, where it\n",

    "slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore; and\n",

    "don’t like this cobbling sort of business—I don’t like it at all; it’s\n",
    "undignified; it’s not my place. Let tinkers’ brats do tinkerings; we\n",
    "are their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,\n",
    "fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at\n",
    "the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at\n",
    "the conclusion; not a cobbler’s job, that’s at an end in the middle,\n",
    "and at the beginning at the end. It’s the old woman’s tricks to be\n",
    "giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for\n",
    "tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a\n",
    "bald-headed young tinker once. And that’s the reason I never would work\n",
    "for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the\n",
    "Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run\n",
    "off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let\n",
    "me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with\n",
    "pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over\n",
    "the ship’s stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some\n",
    "superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere\n",
    "they would do the job. But I’m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I\n",
    "don’t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard\n",
    "tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and\n",

    "by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore\n",

    "if we can. Hem! I’ll do the job, now, tenderly. I’ll have me—let’s\n",

    "leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to\n",
    "increase her distance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last\n",
    "safe aboard, she crowded all sail—stunsail on stunsail—after the\n",
    "missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every\n",

    "last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all\n",
    "around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again\n",
    "paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing\n",
    "till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been\n",
    "seen.\n",

    "The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his\n",
    "object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his\n",
    "own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles\n",
    "apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that some one\n",
    "in that missing boat wore off that Captain’s best coat; mayhap, his\n",
    "watch—he’s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two\n",
    "pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height\n",
    "of the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he looks—pale in\n",
    "the very buttons of his eyes—look—it wasn’t the coat—it must have been\n",
    "the—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“My boy, my own boy is among them. For God’s sake—I beg, I\n",
    "conjure”—here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had\n",
    "but icily received his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me\n",
    "charter your ship—I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it—if\n",
    "there be no other way—for eight-and-forty hours only—only that—you\n",
    "must, oh, you must, and you _shall_ do this thing.”\n",

    "the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the\n",
    "Captain’s sons among the number of the missing boat’s crew; but among\n",
    "the number of the other boat’s crews, at the same time, but on the\n",
    "other hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the\n",
    "chase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the\n",
    "wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity;\n",
    "which was only solved for him by his chief mate’s instinctively\n",
    "adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,\n",
    "that is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to\n",
    "pick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown\n",
    "constitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not\n",
    "till forced to it by Ahab’s iciness did he allude to his one yet\n",
    "missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the\n",
    "earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer’s paternal love, had\n",
    "thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a\n",
    "vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it\n",
    "unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such\n",
    "tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years’ voyage\n",
    "in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a\n",

    "Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel\n",
    "was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,\n",
    "however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung\n",

    "it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting\n",
    "polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months’ night\n",
    "sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab’s purpose now\n",

    "domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,\n",

    "strove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed\n",

    "\n",
    "But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when\n",

    "substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen\n",
    "being’s body. And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by\n",
    "night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go\n",

    "\n",
    "Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the\n",
    "deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole,\n",
    "or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,—the\n",
    "main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the\n",
    "cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step;\n",
    "his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he\n",
    "stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung\n",
    "in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never\n",
    "tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at\n",
    "times; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter,\n",
    "though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and\n",
    "the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved\n",
    "coat and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day’s\n",
    "sunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night;\n",
    "he went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin\n",
    "that thing he sent for.\n",
    "\n",
    "He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,—breakfast and\n",
    "dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly\n",
    "grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still\n",
    "grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But\n",
    "though his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the\n",
    "Parsee’s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these\n",
    "two never seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals\n",
    "some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent\n",
    "spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck\n",
    "crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak\n",
    "one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the\n",
    "slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a\n",
    "single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his\n",
    "scuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each\n",
    "other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the\n",
    "Parsee his abandoned substance.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet, somehow, did Ahab—in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,\n",
    "and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,—Ahab\n",
    "seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both\n",
    "seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean\n",
    "shade siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and\n",
    "keel was solid Ahab.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard\n",
    "from aft,—“Man the mast-heads!”—and all through the day, till after\n",
    "sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking\n",
    "of the helmsman’s bell, was heard—“What d’ye see?—sharp! sharp!”\n",
    "\n",
    "But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the\n",
    "children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac\n",
    "old man seemed distrustful of his crew’s fidelity; at least, of nearly\n",
    "all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether\n",
    "Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But\n",
    "if these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from\n",
    "verbally expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I will have the first sight of the whale myself,”—he said. “Aye! Ahab\n",
    "must have the doubloon!” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of\n",
    "basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved\n",
    "block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the\n",
    "downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin\n",
    "for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with\n",
    "that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round\n",
    "upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long\n",
    "upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then\n",
    "settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“Take the\n",
    "rope, sir—I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.” Then arranging his\n",
    "person in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his\n",
    "perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and\n",
    "afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the\n",
    "royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,—ahead,\n",
    "astern, this side, and that,—within the wide expanded circle commanded\n",
    "at so great a height.\n",
    "\n",
    "When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in\n",
    "the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is\n",
    "hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these\n",
    "circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict\n",
    "charge to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such\n",
    "a wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations\n",
    "aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at\n",
    "the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few\n",
    "minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural\n",
    "fatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor\n",
    "should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all\n",
    "swooping to the sea. So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not\n",
    "unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck,\n",
    "almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with\n",
    "anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision—one of those\n",
    "too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt\n",
    "somewhat;—it was strange, that this was the very man he should select\n",
    "for his watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise\n",
    "distrusted person’s hands.\n",

    "Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten\n",
    "minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly\n",
    "incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\n",
    "latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\n",
    "head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a\n",
    "thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and\n",
    "went eddying again round his head.\n",
    "\n",
    "But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed\n",
    "not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked\n",
    "it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least\n",
    "heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every\n",
    "sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Your hat, your hat, sir!” suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who\n",
    "being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though\n",
    "somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing\n",
    "them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But already the sable wing was before the old man’s eyes; the long\n",
    "hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with\n",
    "his prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin’s head, removing his cap to replace\n",
    "it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be\n",
    "king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen\n",
    "accounted good. Ahab’s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on\n",
    "and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared;\n",
    "while from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was\n",
    "dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.\n",

    "The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the\n",
    "life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably\n",
    "misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were\n",
    "fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some\n",

    "feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and\n",

    "now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,\n",
    "half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.\n",

    "“Hast seen the White Whale?”\n",

    "“Not forged!” and snatching Perth’s levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab\n",
    "held it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold\n",
    "his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these\n",
    "barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the\n",

    "“Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to the\n",

    "yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only _that_ one I bury; the rest\n",
    "were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then turning\n",
    "to his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and\n",

    "\n",
    "It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were\n",
    "hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was\n",
    "transparently pure and soft, with a woman’s look, and the robust and\n",
    "man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s\n",
    "chest in his sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,\n",
    "unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;\n",
    "but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed\n",
    "mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,\n",
    "troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.\n",
    "\n",
    "But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and\n",
    "shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,\n",
    "that distinguished them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle\n",
    "air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the\n",
    "girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion—most seen\n",
    "here at the equator—denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving\n",
    "alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm\n",
    "and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the\n",
    "ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the\n",
    "morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl’s\n",
    "forehead of heaven.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged\n",
    "creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how\n",
    "oblivious were ye of old Ahab’s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen\n",
    "little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around\n",
    "their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on\n",
    "the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side\n",
    "and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the\n",
    "more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the\n",
    "lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a\n",
    "moment, the cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that\n",
    "winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world,\n",
    "so long cruel—forbidding—now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn\n",
    "neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that\n",
    "however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save\n",
    "and to bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into\n",
    "the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee\n",
    "drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;\n",
    "and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing\n",
    "that stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to\n",
    "touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood\n",
    "there.\n",

    "years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and\n",
    "storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab\n",
    "forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors\n",
    "of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not\n",
    "spent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the\n",

    "sympathy from the green country without—oh, weariness! heaviness!\n",
    "Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command!—when I think of all this;\n",
    "only half-suspected, not so keenly known to me before—and how for forty\n",
    "years I have fed upon dry salted fare—fit emblem of the dry nourishment\n",
    "of my soil!—when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily\n",

    "whole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and\n",
    "sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage\n",
    "pillow—wife? wife?—rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I\n",
    "widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the\n",
    "madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with\n",
    "which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly\n",
    "chased his prey—more a demon than a man!—aye, aye! what a forty years’\n",
    "fool—fool—old fool, has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the chase?\n",
    "why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?\n",
    "how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not\n",
    "hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been\n",
    "snatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me,\n",
    "that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some\n",
    "ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I feel\n",
    "deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering\n",
    "beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!—crack my\n",
    "heart!—stave my brain!—mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey\n",
    "hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus\n",
    "intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a\n",
    "human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to\n",
    "gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is\n",
    "the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;\n",
    "stay on board, on board!—lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives\n",
    "chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with\n",

    "\n",
    "“Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!\n",
    "why should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us\n",
    "fly these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are\n",
    "Starbuck’s—wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow\n",
    "youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,\n",
    "longing, paternal old age! Away! let us away!—this instant let me alter\n",
    "the course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl\n",
    "on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some\n",
    "such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“They have, they have. I have seen them—some summer days in the\n",
    "morning. About this time—yes, it is his noon nap now—the boy\n",
    "vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of\n",

    "“What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what\n",

    "commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep\n",
    "pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly\n",
    "making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not\n",
    "so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this\n",
    "arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy\n",
    "in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible\n",
    "power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain\n",
    "think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does\n",
    "that living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round\n",
    "in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all\n",
    "the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon\n",
    "Albicore! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where\n",
    "do murderers go, man! Who’s to doom, when the judge himself is dragged\n",
    "to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and\n",
    "the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have\n",
    "been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and\n",
    "the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we\n",
    "how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust\n",
    "amid greenness; as last year’s scythes flung down, and left in the\n",
    "half-cut swaths—Starbuck!”\n",
    "\n",
    "But blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at\n",

    "CHAPTER 133. The Chase—First Day.\n",
    "\n",
    "That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man—as his wont at\n",
    "intervals—stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went\n",
    "to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing\n",
    "up the sea air as a sagacious ship’s dog will, in drawing nigh to some\n",
    "barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that\n",
    "peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living\n",
    "sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner\n",
    "surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane,\n",
    "and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as\n",
    "possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship’s course to be slightly\n",
    "altered, and the sail to be shortened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated\n",
    "at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and\n",
    "lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery\n",
    "wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift\n",
    "tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle\n",
    "deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they\n",
    "seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear\n",
    "with their clothes in their hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Nothing, nothing sir!” was the sound hailing down in reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "“T’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!”\n",
    "\n",
    "All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for\n",
    "swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were\n",
    "hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and\n",
    "while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the\n",
    "main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the\n",
    "air. “There she blows!—there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is\n",
    "Moby Dick!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\n",
    "look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\n",
    "whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final\n",
    "perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\n",
    "beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian’s\n",
    "head was almost on a level with Ahab’s heel. From this height the whale\n",
    "was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing\n",
    "his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into\n",
    "the air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they\n",
    "had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\n",
    "\n",
    "“And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the perched men\n",
    "all around him.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I\n",
    "cried out,” said Tashtego.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Not the same instant; not the same—no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\n",
    "reserved the doubloon for me. _I_ only; none of ye could have raised\n",
    "the White Whale first. There she blows!—there she blows!—there she\n",
    "blows! There again!—there again!” he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,\n",
    "methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale’s\n",
    "visible jets. “He’s going to sound! In stunsails! Down\n",
    "top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay\n",
    "on board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So;\n",
    "steady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All\n",
    "ready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck;\n",
    "lower, lower,—quick, quicker!” and he slid through the air to the deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "“He is heading straight to leeward, sir,” cried Stubb, “right away from\n",
    "us; cannot have seen the ship yet.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!—brace up!\n",
    "Shiver her!—shiver her!—So; well that! Boats, boats!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon all the boats but Starbuck’s were dropped; all the boat-sails\n",
    "set—all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\n",
    "leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up\n",
    "Fedallah’s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;\n",
    "but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew\n",
    "still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a\n",
    "noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter\n",
    "came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling\n",
    "hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated\n",
    "thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,\n",
    "greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly\n",
    "projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged\n",
    "waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky\n",
    "forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and\n",
    "behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving\n",
    "valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and\n",
    "danced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of\n",
    "hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their\n",
    "fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull\n",
    "of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected\n",
    "from the white whale’s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of\n",
    "soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over\n",
    "the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail\n",
    "feathers streaming like pennons.\n",
    "\n",
    "A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested\n",
    "the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with\n",
    "ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering\n",
    "eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,\n",
    "rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that\n",
    "great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so\n",
    "divinely swam.\n",
    "\n",
    "On each soft side—coincident with the parted swell, that but once\n",
    "leaving him, then flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the whale\n",
    "shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who\n",
    "namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured\n",
    "to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of\n",
    "tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all\n",
    "who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way\n",
    "thou may’st have bejuggled and destroyed before.\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among\n",
    "waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby\n",
    "Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his\n",
    "submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.\n",
    "But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an\n",
    "instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia’s\n",
    "Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air,\n",
    "the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.\n",
    "Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls\n",
    "longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.\n",
    "\n",
    "With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\n",
    "the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "“An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he gazed\n",
    "beyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing\n",
    "vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed\n",
    "whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze\n",
    "now freshened; the sea began to swell.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego.\n",
    "\n",
    "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now\n",
    "all flying towards Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards began\n",
    "fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,\n",
    "expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could\n",
    "discover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down\n",
    "into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a\n",
    "white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it\n",
    "rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long\n",
    "crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\n",
    "undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw;\n",
    "his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.\n",
    "The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble\n",
    "tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled\n",
    "the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon\n",
    "Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and\n",
    "seizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and\n",
    "stand by to stern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\n",
    "its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale’s head while yet\n",
    "under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that\n",
    "malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\n",
    "himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\n",
    "lengthwise beneath the boat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for\n",
    "an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a\n",
    "biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\n",
    "mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into\n",
    "the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish\n",
    "pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab’s\n",
    "head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale\n",
    "now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With\n",
    "unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\n",
    "tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other’s heads to gain the\n",
    "uttermost stern.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the\n",
    "whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his\n",
    "body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from\n",
    "the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while\n",
    "the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis\n",
    "impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with\n",
    "this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and\n",
    "helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized\n",
    "the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from\n",
    "its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the\n",
    "frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\n",
    "enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in\n",
    "twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the\n",
    "two floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the\n",
    "crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold\n",
    "fast to the oars to lash them across.\n",
    "\n",
    "At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first\n",
    "to perceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\n",
    "movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had\n",
    "made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only\n",
    "slipping further into the whale’s mouth, and tilting over sideways as\n",
    "it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him\n",
    "out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the\n",
    "sea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\n",
    "distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\n",
    "billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;\n",
    "so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet\n",
    "out of the water—the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,\n",
    "dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray\n",
    "still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel\n",
    "billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to\n",
    "overleap its summit with their scud.\n",
    "\n",
    "*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its\n",
    "designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\n",
    "up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\n",
    "pitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best\n",
    "and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.\n",
    "\n",
    "But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round\n",
    "and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful\n",
    "wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly\n",
    "assault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the\n",
    "blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus’s elephants in the\n",
    "book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the\n",
    "whale’s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,—though he\n",
    "could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;\n",
    "helpless Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least\n",
    "chance shock might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah\n",
    "incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other\n",
    "drifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to\n",
    "look to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’s\n",
    "aspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,\n",
    "that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other\n",
    "boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into\n",
    "the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\n",
    "destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\n",
    "case could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,\n",
    "they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had\n",
    "now become the old man’s head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’s\n",
    "mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;\n",
    "and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!—“Sail on\n",
    "the”—but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and\n",
    "whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing\n",
    "to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him\n",
    "off!”\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pequod’s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\n",
    "she effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly\n",
    "swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\n",
    "brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab’s bodily\n",
    "strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a\n",
    "time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb’s boat, like one trodden\n",
    "under foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from\n",
    "him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\n",
    "abbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense\n",
    "to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused\n",
    "through feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary\n",
    "in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time\n",
    "aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous\n",
    "intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures\n",
    "contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\n",
    "one bended arm—“is it safe?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Lay it before me;—any missing men?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir, and here are\n",
    "five men.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“That’s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there!\n",
    "there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands off from me!\n",
    "The eternal sap runs up in Ahab’s bones again! Set the sail; out oars;\n",
    "the helm!”\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked\n",
    "up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is\n",
    "thus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now.\n",
    "But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the\n",
    "whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with\n",
    "a velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these\n",
    "circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely\n",
    "prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long\n",
    "a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing\n",
    "barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself,\n",
    "then, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate\n",
    "means of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her,\n",
    "and were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked\n",
    "boat having been previously secured by her—and then hoisting everything\n",
    "to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways\n",
    "outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an\n",
    "albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At\n",
    "the well known, methodic intervals, the whale’s glittering spout was\n",
    "regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be\n",
    "reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing\n",
    "the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\n",
    "allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now?\n",
    "D’ye see him?” and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded\n",
    "them to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now\n",
    "aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men\n",
    "aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a\n",
    "still greater breadth—thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat,\n",
    "at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped\n",
    "upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered\n",
    "stern. At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded\n",
    "sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old\n",
    "man’s face there now stole some such added gloom as this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to\n",
    "evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in\n",
    "his Captain’s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed—“The\n",
    "thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did\n",
    "I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could\n",
    "swear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a\n",
    "wreck.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an omen,\n",
    "and an ill one.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Omen? omen?—the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to\n",
    "man, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and\n",
    "give an old wives’ darkling hint.—Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles\n",
    "of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye\n",
    "two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the\n",
    "peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How\n",
    "now? Aloft there! D’ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he\n",
    "spout ten times a second!”\n",
    "\n",
    "The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.\n",
    "Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Can’t see the spout now, sir;—too dark”—cried a voice from the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "“How heading when last seen?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“As before, sir,—straight to leeward.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Good! he will travel slower now ’tis night. Down royals and\n",
    "top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before\n",
    "morning; he’s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm\n",
    "there! keep her full before the wind!—Aloft! come down!—Mr. Stubb, send\n",
    "a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till\n",
    "morning.”—Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast—“Men,\n",
    "this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till\n",
    "the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,\n",
    "upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man’s; and if on\n",
    "that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be\n",
    "divided among all of ye! Away now!—the deck is thine, sir!”\n",
    "\n",
    "And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and\n",
    "slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals\n",
    "rousing himself to see how the night wore on.\n",

    "CHAPTER 134. The Chase—Second Day.\n",
    "\n",
    "At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "“D’ye see him?” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light\n",
    "to spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "“See nothing, sir.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought\n",
    "for;—the top-gallant sails!—aye, they should have been kept on her all\n",
    "night. But no matter—’tis but resting for the rush.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular\n",
    "whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, is\n",
    "a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is\n",
    "the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible\n",
    "confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket\n",
    "commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last\n",
    "descried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty\n",
    "accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to\n",
    "swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of\n",
    "progression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a\n",
    "pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he\n",
    "well knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at\n",
    "some further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes\n",
    "the precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more\n",
    "certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be\n",
    "visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for\n",
    "after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of\n",
    "daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature’s future\n",
    "wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious\n",
    "mind of the hunter, as the pilot’s coast is to him. So that to this\n",
    "hunter’s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in\n",
    "water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the\n",
    "steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway\n",
    "is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their\n",
    "hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’s pulse; and lightly\n",
    "say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a\n",
    "spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions\n",
    "when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,\n",
    "according to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so\n",
    "many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have\n",
    "about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to\n",
    "render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the\n",
    "sea must be the whaleman’s allies; for of what present avail to the\n",
    "becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is\n",
    "exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable\n",
    "from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the\n",
    "chase of whales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a\n",
    "cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level\n",
    "field.\n",
    "\n",
    "“By salt and hemp!” cried Stubb, “but this swift motion of the deck\n",
    "creeps up one’s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two\n",
    "brave fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,\n",
    "on the sea,—for by live-oaks! my spine’s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait\n",
    "that leaves no dust behind!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“There she blows—she blows!—she blows!—right ahead!” was now the\n",
    "mast-head cry.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, aye!” cried Stubb, “I knew it—ye can’t escape—blow on and split\n",
    "your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your\n",
    "trump—blister your lungs!—Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller\n",
    "shuts his watergate upon the stream!”\n",
    "\n",
    "And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies\n",
    "of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine\n",
    "worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might\n",
    "have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the\n",
    "growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,\n",
    "as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand\n",
    "of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the\n",
    "previous day; the rack of the past night’s suspense; the fixed,\n",
    "unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging\n",
    "towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled\n",
    "along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the\n",
    "vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of\n",
    "that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.\n",
    "\n",
    "They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;\n",
    "though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple,\n",
    "and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each\n",
    "other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced\n",
    "and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities\n",
    "of the crew, this man’s valor, that man’s fear; guilt and guiltiness,\n",
    "all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that\n",
    "fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\n",
    "outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one\n",
    "hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,\n",
    "shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking\n",
    "yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for\n",
    "their fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to\n",
    "seek out the thing that might destroy them!\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after\n",
    "the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.\n",
    "“Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd\n",
    "jet that way, and then disappears.”\n",
    "\n",
    "It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some\n",
    "other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for\n",
    "hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its\n",
    "pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the\n",
    "air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant\n",
    "halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as—much nearer to the ship\n",
    "than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—Moby Dick\n",
    "bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not\n",
    "by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the\n",
    "White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous\n",
    "phenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the\n",
    "furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the\n",
    "pure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows\n",
    "his place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,\n",
    "the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,\n",
    "this breaching is his act of defiance.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There she breaches! there she breaches!” was the cry, as in his\n",
    "immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\n",
    "Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\n",
    "against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\n",
    "for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\n",
    "stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\n",
    "intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour\n",
    "and thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the\n",
    "fore. The boats!—stand by!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\n",
    "shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\n",
    "halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\n",
    "from his perch.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a spare one,\n",
    "rigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine—keep\n",
    "away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!”\n",
    "\n",
    "As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\n",
    "assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the\n",
    "three crews. Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told\n",
    "them he would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull straight up\n",
    "to his forehead,—a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,\n",
    "such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale’s sidelong\n",
    "vision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three\n",
    "boats were plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale\n",
    "churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,\n",
    "rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered\n",
    "appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him\n",
    "from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank\n",
    "of which those boats were made. But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly\n",
    "wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while\n",
    "eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank’s breadth; while all the\n",
    "time, Ahab’s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.\n",
    "\n",
    "But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\n",
    "and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three\n",
    "lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,\n",
    "warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now\n",
    "for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more\n",
    "tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more\n",
    "line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping\n",
    "that way to disencumber it of some snarls—when lo!—a sight more savage\n",
    "than the embattled teeth of sharks!\n",
    "\n",
    "Caught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons\n",
    "and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing\n",
    "and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab’s boat. Only one\n",
    "thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached\n",
    "within—through—and then, without—the rays of steel; dragged in the line\n",
    "beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering\n",
    "the rope near the chocks—dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into\n",
    "the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a\n",
    "sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so\n",
    "doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask\n",
    "towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a\n",
    "surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a\n",
    "boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of\n",
    "the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly\n",
    "stirred bowl of punch.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after\n",
    "the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while\n",
    "aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching\n",
    "his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was\n",
    "lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old\n",
    "man’s line—now parting—admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to\n",
    "rescue whom he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand\n",
    "concreted perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards\n",
    "Heaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly\n",
    "from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its\n",
    "bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\n",
    "again—gunwale downwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under\n",
    "it, like seals from a sea-side cave.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first uprising momentum of the whale—modifying its direction as he\n",
    "struck the surface—involuntarily launched him along it, to a little\n",
    "distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his\n",
    "back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from\n",
    "side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or\n",
    "crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and\n",
    "came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work\n",
    "for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the\n",
    "ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\n",
    "leeward way at a traveller’s methodic pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\n",
    "came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\n",
    "floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\n",
    "and safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists,\n",
    "and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\n",
    "inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these\n",
    "were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen\n",
    "any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly\n",
    "clinging to his boat’s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy\n",
    "float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day’s mishap.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as\n",
    "instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of\n",
    "Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory\n",
    "leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he\n",
    "will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I\n",
    "put good work into that leg.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“But no bones broken, sir, I hope,” said Stubb with true concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But even with a\n",
    "broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of\n",
    "mine one jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white whale,\n",
    "nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and\n",
    "inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape\n",
    "yonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Dead to leeward, sir.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of\n",

    "\n",
    "“Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the\n",
    "unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sir?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane—there, that\n",
    "shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet.\n",
    "By heaven it cannot be!—missing?—quick! call them all.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The old man’s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the\n",
    "Parsee was not there.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must have been caught in——”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin,\n",
    "forecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”\n",
    "\n",
    "But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was\n",
    "nowhere to be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, sir,” said Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I thought\n",
    "I saw him dragging under.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“_My_ line! _my_ line? Gone?—gone? What means that little word?—What\n",
    "death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.\n",
    "The harpoon, too!—toss over the litter there,—d’ye see it?—the forged\n",
    "iron, men, the white whale’s—no, no, no,—blistered fool! this hand did\n",
    "dart it!—’tis in the fish!—Aloft there! Keep him nailed—Quick!—all\n",
    "hands to the rigging of the boats—collect the oars—harpooneers! the\n",
    "irons, the irons!—hoist the royals higher—a pull on all the\n",
    "sheets!—helm there! steady, steady for your life! I’ll ten times girdle\n",

    "“Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,” cried Starbuck;\n",
    "“never, never wilt thou capture him, old man—In Jesus’ name no more of\n",
    "this, that’s worse than devil’s madness. Two days chased; twice stove\n",
    "to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil\n",
    "shadow gone—all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:—what more\n",
    "wouldst thou have?—Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he\n",
    "swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the\n",
    "sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,—Impiety\n",
    "and blasphemy to hunt him more!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Starbuck, of late I’ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that\n",
    "hour we both saw—thou know’st what, in one another’s eyes. But in this\n",
    "matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this\n",
    "hand—a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This\n",
    "whole act’s immutably decreed. ’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion\n",
    "years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates’ lieutenant; I act\n",
    "under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.—Stand round\n",
    "me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered\n",
    "lance; propped up on a lonely foot. ’Tis Ahab—his body’s part; but\n",
    "Ahab’s soul’s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel\n",
    "strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a\n",
    "gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye’ll hear me crack; and till\n",
    "ye hear _that_, know that Ahab’s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe\n",
    "ye, men, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!\n",
    "For ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface;\n",
    "then rise again, to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick—two days he’s\n",
    "floated—tomorrow will be the third. Aye, men, he’ll rise once more,—but\n",
    "only to spout his last! D’ye feel brave men, brave?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“As fearless fire,” cried Stubb.\n",
    "\n",
    "“And as mechanical,” muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he\n",
    "muttered on: “The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same\n",
    "to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek\n",
    "to drive out of others’ hearts what’s clinched so fast in mine!—The\n",
    "Parsee—the Parsee!—gone, gone? and he was to go before:—but still was\n",
    "to be seen again ere I could perish—How’s that?—There’s a riddle now\n",
    "might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of\n",

    "though!”\n",
    "\n",
    "When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.\n",
    "\n",
    "So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on\n",
    "the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the\n",
    "grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by\n",
    "lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and\n",
    "sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken\n",
    "keel of Ahab’s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while\n",
    "still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his\n",
    "scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its\n",

    "\n",
    "The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the\n",
    "solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the\n",
    "daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.\n",
    "\n",
    "“D’ye see him?” cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "“In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that’s all. Helm\n",
    "there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day\n",
    "again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the\n",
    "angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a\n",
    "fairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here’s food for thought, had\n",
    "Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels;\n",
    "_that’s_ tingling enough for mortal man! to think’s audacity. God only\n",
    "has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness\n",
    "and a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too\n",
    "much for that. And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very\n",
    "calm—frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the\n",
    "contents turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing\n",
    "now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it’s like\n",
    "that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy\n",
    "clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow\n",
    "it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the\n",
    "tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this\n",
    "through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and\n",
    "ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.\n",
    "Out upon it!—it’s tainted. Were I the wind, I’d blow no more on such a\n",
    "wicked, miserable world. I’d crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink\n",
    "there. And yet, ’tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever\n",
    "conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow. Run\n",
    "tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that\n",
    "strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow.\n",
    "Even Ahab is a braver thing—a nobler thing than _that_. Would now the\n",
    "wind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and\n",
    "outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as\n",
    "objects, not as agents. There’s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a\n",
    "most malicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that\n",
    "there’s something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm\n",
    "Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in\n",
    "strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark,\n",
    "however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest\n",
    "Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go\n",
    "at last. And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly\n",

    "\n",
    "“Nothing, sir.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun!\n",
    "Aye, aye, it must be so. I’ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye,\n",
    "he’s chasing _me_ now; not I, _him_—that’s bad; I might have known it,\n",
    "too. Fool! the lines—the harpoons he’s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him\n",
    "by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look\n",
    "outs! Man the braces!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod’s\n",
    "quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced\n",

    "white wake.\n",

    "himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. “God\n",

    "“We should meet him soon.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, aye, sir,” and straightway Starbuck did Ahab’s bidding, and once\n",
    "more Ahab swung on high.\n",
    "\n",
    "A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held\n",
    "long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the\n",
    "weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the\n",
    "three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had\n",
    "voiced it.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck\n",
    "there!—brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind’s eye. He’s too far\n",
    "off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that\n",
    "helmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But\n",
    "let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there’s\n",
    "time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and\n",
    "not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of\n",
    "Nantucket! The same!—the same!—the same to Noah as to me. There’s a\n",
    "soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead\n",
    "somewhere—to something else than common land, more palmy than the\n",
    "palms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then;\n",
    "the better if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old\n",
    "mast-head! What’s this?—green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks.\n",
    "No such green weather stains on Ahab’s head! There’s the difference now\n",
    "between man’s old age and matter’s. But aye, old mast, we both grow old\n",
    "together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a\n",
    "leg, that’s all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live\n",
    "flesh every way. I can’t compare with it; and I’ve known some ships\n",
    "made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital\n",
    "stuff of vital fathers. What’s that he said? he should still go before\n",
    "me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at\n",
    "the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and\n",
    "all night I’ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye,\n",
    "aye, like many more thou told’st direful truth as touching thyself, O\n",
    "Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head—keep\n",
    "a good eye upon the whale, the while I’m gone. We’ll talk to-morrow,\n",
    "nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and\n",
    "tail.”\n",
    "\n",
    "He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered\n",
    "through the cloven blue air to the deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop’s\n",
    "stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the\n",
    "mate,—who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck—and bade him pause.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Starbuck!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sir?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“For the third time my soul’s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,\n",
    "Starbuck!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Truth, sir: saddest truth.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the\n",
    "flood;—and I feel now like a billow that’s all one crested comb,\n",
    "Starbuck. I am old;—shake hands with me, man.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck’s tears the glue.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh, my captain, my captain!—noble heart—go not—go not!—see, it’s a\n",
    "brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Lower away!”—cried Ahab, tossing the mate’s arm from him. “Stand by\n",
    "the crew!”\n",
    "\n",
    "In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The sharks! the sharks!” cried a voice from the low cabin-window\n",
    "there; “O master, my master, come back!”\n",
    "\n",
    "But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the\n",
    "boat leaped on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when\n",
    "numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath\n",
    "the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time\n",
    "they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with\n",
    "their bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats\n",
    "in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them\n",
    "in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of\n",
    "marching regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that\n",
    "had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first\n",
    "descried; and whether it was that Ahab’s crew were all such\n",
    "tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the\n",
    "senses of the sharks—a matter sometimes well known to affect\n",
    "them,—however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without\n",
    "molesting the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Heart of wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and\n",
    "following with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly\n",
    "to that sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by\n",
    "them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?—For\n",
    "when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be\n",
    "sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the\n",
    "evening and the end of that thing—be that end what it may. Oh! my God!\n",
    "what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet\n",
    "expectant,—fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me,\n",
    "as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.\n",
    "Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see\n",
    "but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem\n",
    "clearing; but clouds sweep between—Is my journey’s end coming? My legs\n",
    "feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—beats\n",
    "it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!—stave it off—move, move! speak\n",
    "aloud!—Mast-head there! See ye my boy’s hand on the hill?—Crazed;—aloft\n",
    "there!—keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:—mark well the whale!—Ho!\n",
    "again!—drive off that hawk! see! he pecks—he tears the vane”—pointing\n",
    "to the red flag flying at the main-truck—“Ha! he soars away with\n",
    "it!—Where’s the old man now? see’st thou that sight, oh Ahab!—shudder,\n",
    "shudder!”\n",
    "\n",
    "The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads—a\n",
    "downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but\n",
    "intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a\n",
    "little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the\n",
    "profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered\n",
    "against the opposing bow.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads\n",
    "drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and\n",
    "no hearse can be mine:—and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then\n",
    "quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice,\n",
    "swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a\n",
    "subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with\n",
    "trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,\n",
    "but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist,\n",
    "it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping\n",
    "back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for\n",
    "an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of\n",
    "flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the\n",
    "marble trunk of the whale.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Give way!” cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to\n",
    "the attack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corroded in\n",
    "him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell\n",
    "from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad\n",
    "white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;\n",
    "as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more\n",
    "flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two\n",
    "mates’ boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,\n",
    "but leaving Ahab’s almost without a scar.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the\n",
    "whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he\n",
    "shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round\n",
    "and round to the fish’s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in\n",
    "which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of\n",
    "the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his\n",
    "sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old\n",
    "Ahab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The harpoon dropped from his hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye, Parsee! I see\n",
    "thee again.—Aye, and thou goest before; and this, _this_ then is the\n",
    "hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of\n",
    "thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those\n",
    "boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me;\n",
    "if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down, men! the first thing that but\n",
    "offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are\n",
    "not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.—Where’s the\n",
    "whale? gone down again?”\n",
    "\n",
    "But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the\n",
    "corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter\n",
    "had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again\n",
    "steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,—which thus\n",
    "far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the\n",
    "present her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his\n",
    "utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight\n",

    "“Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third\n",
    "day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that\n",
    "madly seekest him!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled\n",
    "to leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding\n",
    "by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’s face as he\n",
    "leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and\n",
    "follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards,\n",
    "he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three\n",
    "mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats\n",
    "which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in\n",
    "repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he\n",
    "sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying\n",
    "themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all\n",
    "this; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers\n",
    "seemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking\n",
    "that the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to\n",
    "Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another\n",
    "flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether fagged by the three days’ running chase, and the resistance to\n",
    "his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some\n",
    "latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White\n",
    "Whale’s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly\n",
    "nearing him once more; though indeed the whale’s last start had not\n",
    "been so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves\n",
    "the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to\n",
    "the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades\n",
    "became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at\n",
    "almost every dip.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull\n",
    "on! ’tis the better rest, the shark’s jaw than the yielding water.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“They will last long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he\n",
    "muttered—“whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on\n",
    "Ahab?—But pull on! Aye, all alive, now—we near him. The helm! take the\n",
    "helm! let me pass,”—and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward\n",
    "to the bows of the still flying boat.\n",
    "\n",
    "At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with\n",
    "the White Whale’s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its\n",
    "advance—as the whale sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the\n",
    "smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale’s spout, curled\n",
    "round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,\n",
    "with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the\n",
    "poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the\n",
    "hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked\n",
    "into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his\n",
    "nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so\n",
    "suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated\n",
    "part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have\n",
    "been tossed into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen—who foreknew\n",
    "not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for\n",
    "its effects—these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two\n",
    "of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a\n",
    "combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man\n",
    "helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\n",
    "instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering\n",
    "sea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with\n",
    "the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their\n",
    "seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line\n",
    "felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!\n",
    "\n",
    "“What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!—’tis whole again; oars! oars!\n",
    "Burst in upon him!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled\n",
    "round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,\n",
    "catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing\n",
    "in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a\n",
    "larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing\n",
    "prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. “I grow blind; hands!\n",
    "stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is’t night?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The whale! The ship!” cried the cringing oarsmen.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for\n",
    "ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I\n",
    "see: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”\n",
    "\n",
    "But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the\n",
    "sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks\n",
    "burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat\n",
    "lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew,\n",
    "trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego’s mast-head hammer\n",
    "remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as\n",
    "with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own\n",
    "forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the\n",
    "bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon\n",
    "as he.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of\n",
    "air, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a\n",
    "woman’s fainting fit. Up helm, I say—ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is\n",
    "this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?\n",
    "Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up\n",
    "helm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on\n",
    "towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me\n",
    "now!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now\n",
    "help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning\n",
    "whale! Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb’s own\n",
    "unwinking eye? And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is\n",
    "all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee,\n",
    "thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins\n",
    "of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would\n",
    "yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh!\n",
    "thou grinning whale, but there’ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye\n",
    "not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his\n",
    "drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;—cherries!\n",
    "cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope\n",
    "my poor mother’s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will\n",
    "now come to her, for the voyage is up.”\n",
    "\n",
    "From the ship’s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,\n",
    "bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their\n",
    "hands, just as they had darted from their various employments; all\n",
    "their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side\n",
    "strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of\n",
    "overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution,\n",
    "swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of\n",
    "all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead\n",
    "smote the ship’s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell\n",
    "flat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the\n",
    "harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the breach,\n",
    "they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The ship! The hearse!—the second hearse!” cried Ahab from the boat;\n",
    "“its wood could only be American!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its\n",
    "keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far\n",
    "off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab’s boat, where, for a\n",
    "time, he lay quiescent.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy\n",
    "hammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel;\n",
    "and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and\n",
    "Pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and\n",
    "without me? Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest\n",
    "shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel\n",
    "my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your\n",
    "furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone\n",
    "life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll,\n",
    "thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with\n",
    "thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last\n",
    "breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!\n",
    "and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still\n",
    "chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! _Thus_, I give up\n",
    "the spear!”\n",
    "\n",
    "The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting\n",
    "velocity the line ran through the grooves;—ran foul. Ahab stooped to\n",
    "clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the\n",
    "neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was\n",
    "shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the\n",
    "heavy eye-splice in the rope’s final end flew out of the stark-empty\n",
    "tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its\n",
    "depths.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an instant, the tranced boat’s crew stood still; then turned. “The\n",
    "ship? Great God, where is the ship?” Soon they through dim, bewildering\n",
    "mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata\n",
    "Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by\n",
    "infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the\n",
    "pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea.\n",
    "And now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its\n",
    "crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning,\n",
    "animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the\n",
    "smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the\n",
    "sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the\n",
    "erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,\n",
    "which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying\n",
    "billows they almost touched;—at that instant, a red arm and a hammer\n",
    "hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the\n",
    "flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that\n",
    "tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home\n",
    "among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there;\n",
    "this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between\n",
    "the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial\n",
    "thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his\n",
    "hammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic\n",
    "shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive\n",
    "form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like\n",
    "Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of\n",
    "heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen\n",
    "white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the\n",
    "great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.\n",

    "The drama’s done. Why then here does any one step forth?—Because one\n",
    "did survive the wreck.\n",
    "\n",
    "It so chanced, that after the Parsee’s disappearance, I was he whom the\n",
    "Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab’s bowsman, when that bowsman\n",
    "assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three\n",
    "men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So,\n",
    "floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it,\n",
    "when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but\n",
    "slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had\n",
    "subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting\n",
    "towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly\n",
    "wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that\n",
    "vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by\n",
    "reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising\n",
    "with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea,\n",
    "fell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost\n",
    "one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main. The\n",
    "unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths;\n",
    "the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a\n",
